I really enjoy this game, I think they could have done better, some of the driving chases just seem a bit silly.  I enjoy the more tactical work he is required to do.  However, I ran into a glitch and I went online and found there are others who had the same problem where you get totally stuck and cannot move forward at all.  I played 2 nights in a row thinking I did something wrong before I looked up a walkthrough online and found out it was just a glitch in the game.  One I followed the instuctions, I was finally able to move on so watch out for that.  It's right after you go up in a watch tower with a sniper rifle, then enter a wharehouse to protect Madsen which as soon as you enter there should be a lot of men coming in, my problem was only 1 guy or other people say no men at all, if that happens then you hit the glitch because a lot of men should come rushing in.  The instructions I followed are as follows: ---  --- Turn on your PS2 is turned off with game and memory card in, then load the game (it should be at 4:28. If its not, see NOTE below).  When the cut scene with Jack and Tony begins remove the memory card and the "Warning, memory card removed  Use save game option to manually save progress & re-enable autosave?"   Press X for OK and re-insert the memory card, then watch the cut scene.  The "Previously on 24" dialog box will appear, press X.  then play the game as usual.  If done correctly, many men will enter.  After you complete the mission, make sure you save it.  ---  --- NOTE: If your memory card is at 4:41.  Go restart the mission and do a save during the cut scene. You will overwrite 4:41 and be back at 4:28. ---  --- It helped me and if it happens to you, believe me, you will be glad you read this because I sure was. 	pos
I have long been skeptical of "deep frying" at home.  The smell, the mess, the smell...Anyway, I recently decided to throw a fish fry and decided it was time to invest in a fryer.  The biggest issue for me in purchasing a fryer was the sturdiness of the burner stand.  Besides having the ability to heat 12 quarts of oil, I also wanted a burner stand that would hold the weight of 20 quarts of beer for my homebrewing.  I decided on the Bayou Classic. ---  --- This Bayou Classic kit came with everything and setup was simple.  The burner stand exceeded my expectations for sturdiness and the height was such that when using the 10 quart stock pot, you could place the burner stand on a safe sturdy work surface to elevate it off the ground.  I plan on also using this burner with my wok.  The burner was able to bring the oil to temperature in approximately 15 minutes.  The Fish and Chips turned out great. ---  --- Of course when using 350 degree boiling oil, you do not want your weekend fry festival to end with either a trip to your local burn unit or a reason to see if Allstate really has you in good hands.  Common sense must prevail and last time I checked, Amazon does not sell that yet.  Set your fry area up away from kids, pets and anything that you want to see another day.  If you follow that simple advice, all should turn out okay.   ---  --- Clean up can be best described as "sticky", but in order to get the life out of your aluminum parts, don't skimp.  Now that I have tackled fish and chips, I will have to move on to the other "must have" fried foods these days: turkeys, chickens, and Twinkies.  I can't wait.	pos

I'm going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo. old son weighs 28 lbs. and should be able to stay in it for alot longer (up to 40 lbs.). The straps are let all the way out and it's still too tight for him. I wouldn't recommend this car seat for chunky babies.	neg
I love Andy Capp Steak Fries but be warned about long shipping times.  It has been two weeks since my order and I haven't received the product.  I don't know if FEDEX style shipping would have helped	pos

I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one.	neg

I originally bought the Edit 120 (no detachable case) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often (to leave at home).  Then I came across the Edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly.  Not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet, I was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment.  It needed to be easy to remove, but it also needed to be secure; the pictures I found on the internet didn't show how it was attached.   ---  --- I was relieved when I actually saw how it was attached.  There is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag (an open slot is at each end).  The add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro.  The attachment method is secure and is almost invisable, and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag.  I think the original bag is very good, and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice.   ---  --- Unfortunately, you have to buy this as a combination.  If you originally bought the 120 single bag version, it doesn't have the slotted bottom on it and can't be retrofitted (and I don't think they sell the detachable bag separately)	pos
maybe it's because he is such a stright shooter(pun ment) or something but clint doesn't do cold war thrillers very well(remember firefox). while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they don't cover up the fact that it was a good book that doesn't watch as good as it read.some may like it but i found it to be a let down	neg
You can't really beat this for $12! It's fairly attractive and seems pretty well made. It seems as though it will do a pretty good job at removing dirt etc. from shoes as the bristles on it are very tough and the crevaces are alot bigger than you can see in the picture. This would cost at least $10 more in the stores. Thinking about buying one for my other 2 entry doors	pos
This game is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the only problem is that in order to get some achievments, you have to play it on veteran mode. Sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle. One time I was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game. Only three shots will kill you. I HAD TO restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it.	pos
The author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. There is value in that. I look forward to reading part two, the liturgical ideas section. The emerging church is keen on praxis, but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within Christendom, which I had hoped we were past.  --- Here are some things that I am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book, which it might help to know: ---  --- 1. Rollins does not think it's possible to really "know" much theology with "certainty." In fact, to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an "idolatrous" view of God that is more our idea of God than really who God is. This is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans, and because in his view, God was not all that interested in presenting much of Himself in any sort of nailed down way.  The irony I could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views. --- He is very certain of his interpretations of "perceptive thinkers like Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx," Eckhart, Augustine, etc... and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from Scripture are correct. I found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really, really, faulty. As I'm reading along I kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the New Testament. So, be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the Bible's basic content.  He is certain that no one should be certain, but him. Ok, to be fair, he is not certain if Christianity is true, and says so on page 44, but he is certain that he should not be certain of Christianity. Nor, I guess, should you. With his view of "critique of ideology" how can he be so selective of what he is certain of. This seems like a self-defeating ideology.  --- So strong is his disdain for "knowing" with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all. I was reminded of the case Francis Schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true, but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway. Rollins needs to reread his Francis Schaeffer, in my opinion.  --- He says the church is not to be about giving answers, but helping raise in people: questioning. Indeed, given his views, how could he provide answers? This book may look deep. I propose, it is merely muddy. ---  --- 2. He redefines age old terms. Orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes, but how loosely one holds it. Certainty of revealed truth is dangerous, misinformed, idolatrous. Heresy is now a cute little thing. It has come of age. He says people will think his views undermine Christianity. We are to just take him at his word that his views won't do so, but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would, I think, see the writing on the wall. ---   --- 3. He seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns. After reading his views I wonder if it is possible for post moderns, those like himself, at least, to even understand the gospel. He has not. How can he be a bridge? To be a bridge one must have footing on both shores. Christianity IS based on real events with real content that has been passed down, not without mystery, nor without debate, but in a very real and tangible way. he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else. ---   --- 4. He is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them. The problem that is huge, and no one seems to notice, is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the Christians who are in other camps. He considers fundamentalists,and by logical extension many evangelicals, to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term, heresy. I kept thinking, what kind of "fundamentalists" is he so angry at? He blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals, making generalizations that are misleading. Very unobjective. Unkind. Very divisive. Yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to Christendom. I can see his views bringing unity to all religions, but it will never bring unity to Christendom. He seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in Christendom. Times have really changed in the past 20 years. He is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind.  ---  --- 5. He makes God hopelessly difficult. God wanted, it seems, to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people, the dust of humanity, the lowly donkey ride, the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel. Rollins has wrapped God up in Nietzsche and while disdaining "human reason" as the means of knowing God has turned the living Christ who said "I am the truth" into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it. God's message is simple. It's clear where it needs to be. It hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated. Rollins makes it nearly all enigma, hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking God, who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it, yet Who has been unwilling or incapable, given man's weaknesses, or His own lack of communication skills, to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly. --- If, as Tickle says, this is the Christianity of the 3rd millenium, then the Chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man's religion, the anything goes religion, and following generations will have to deconstruct today's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism. Peter, I can learn some stuff from you, and I'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission. As it stands now I cannot agree with you on several points. Your views trouble me. Nothing against you personally.  Forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone. I hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more, though, it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor. Regardless, if it inspires I'll come back and add a star. hmmm	neg
After sixteen long years, Final Fantasy III finally sees an official release outside of Japan.  However, unlike previous games, Final Fantasy III has been completely reworked.  This is more than just a port with enhanced graphics.  Final Fantasy III includes some new secrets and side quests in addition to its graphical overhaul.  Final Fantasy III may be just about enough to please some hardcore fans, but was the wait really worth it?  Well, yes, but the game isn't perfect.   ---  --- The storyline of Final Fantasy III is entirely too simple.  The crystals are losing their powers and there are only four warriors that can come forth and save the world from falling into darkness.  Sixteen years ago this was a pretty standard story, but when compared to your average RPG today, and current Final Fantasy games, the storyline to Final Fantasy III is a joke.  There's nothing in this story that screams epic, and the characters involved aren't developed very well.  Luckily, we can let it slide because its sixteen years old.  ---  --- Gameplay wise, Final Fantasy III is pretty similar to most RPGs of today.  You'll go roaming through dungeons and towns getting into random battles.  There are a few quirks to the game that the DS utilizes.  You'll find moments where you'll have to zoom into certain objects for you to examine.  It should also be noted that you can use the touch screen almost exclusively in the game.  Using the stylus you can make your character run in the direction you want him to, by gliding it across the screen.  Taping on things makes your character examine it, and ultimately this is how you open chests and talk to people.  It works out, but it feels really clumbsy at times.  If you're looking to get through a dungeon with little hassle, just stick to the directional buttons.  To its credit, though, using the stylus makes menu navigation much faster, but for the most part, the stylus controls just feel tacked on.   ---  --- Combat is traditional turn based combat.  There's no ATB gauge like in later Final Fantasy games.  In each round you will choose all the commands for your characters to do, and then watch a round of battle take place.  It's simple, but isn't always fun.  Mainly because Final Fantasy III is a challenge.  If you began with some of the later Final Fantasy games, then this installment may be a little too difficult.  Sometimes combat is unforgiving, especially when faced with bosses that attack twice per turn, and have the power to take out a character in a single shot.  Even worse, the encounter rate is pretty high and running away from battle is often a wasted effort because you'll fail so many times trying to do so.  You'll probably get wiped out just trying to run from battle and failing so many times.  There are several moments when you'll be forced to battle for hours just leveling up.  This is fine for those used to old school RPGs, but many RPGs of today do not put so much emphasis on leveling up, and it may try your patience after a while.  It's great for people looking for a challenge, at least, but for some it may be a bit too steep.   ---  --- The job system is interesting.  As you go through the game you'll get crystal shards that allow your characters to use certain jobs.  Each job has its own set of abilities that can be learned with it.  For example, White mages specialize in the healing arts, black mages in attack magic and red mages can do a little bit of both.  You've also got other classes like warriors who can take damage for other party members, thieves who can steal and much more.  There are 23 jobs in all, and the possibilities are nearly endless.  The jobs you choose for your characters also have an impact on your stats.  Mages, for example, don't have a lot of strength but they excel in magic.  Also, as you gain levels, you'll also gain job levels.  So it's not only important to make sure your characters are at a good level, but also at a good job level.   ---  --- The game looks absolutely stunning, at least for the Nintendo DS.  It is by far one of the best looking out there.  There are some moments where it looks pixilated, but you can't deny that the game just looks good regardless.  The movie sequences are also really pretty to look at and they run surprisingly well.  In battle is also fantastic.  Your enemies sport some amazing detail and so do the backgrounds in battle.  On the whole, the game just looks good.  Perhaps the only fault of the graphics is how restricted the animation of characters and enemies are in combat.  Your characters won't physically go up and strike an enemy.  Rather they just step forward and swing.  Very similar to how the Final Fantasy games of the NES worked.  It's strange to see, but you'll quickly get used to it.   ---  --- Another thing that seems kind of strange, though, is that the top screen throughout most of the game remains blank.  All the action takes place on the bottom screen.  There are few moments when the top screen actually displays anything.  You'll see the world map as you travel the overworld and while you're in towns.  There are certain moments where the top screen has text, or shows an important story sequence, but that's usually about it.  Other than that, when trumping through dungeons (as you do often) and in battle (as you also do often) the top screen remains blank.  There's nothing wrong with it, but it feels very awkward to play a Nintendo DS game where the top screen is blank.  They could've used it to display dungeon maps or enemy information or something.  The top screen has no impact on gameplay whatsoever.     ---  --- The music in the game is pretty good, though.  It's not as good as other games in the series, and there are some tunes that just aren't great, but the music is by no means bad.  There's no voice acting in the game, really, but we can let that slide.  Audio wise, the game is good. ---  --- Final Fantasy III is a pretty satisfying experience for any Final Fantasy fan looking for a good challenge, and to see how far the series has come.  However, it may also shed a little too much of its old school charm in some areas, particularly its unforgiving challenge.  Still, it's worth it for Final Fantasy fans who want to see just how far the series has come. ---  --- The Good ---  --- +Finally a chance to play Final Fantasy III --- +Great visual look --- +Good music --- +The job system is interesting --- +It provides a good challenge --- +A fair amount of secrets and sidequests ---  --- The Bad ---  --- -The story is not all that great --- -For some the game might provide too much of a challenge, to the point of frustration --- -High random encounter rate --- -Throughout most of your adventure the top screen is just... blank... for a Nintendo DS game this just feels awkwar	pos
This is NOT a high-tech digital frame. It doesn't play MP3's.  It doesn't come with a remote.  It simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode.  There's an "on" button and an "off" button.  There is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame (though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet).  It's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off.  If you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location, or choreograph your pictures with music, then this is not the frame for you	pos
I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money. ---  --- After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it	neg
Many thanks to the earlier reviewers who recommended the Amigo.  We bought both the guitar and case for our 5-year-old daughter to take to weekly lessons and we couldn't be happier.  The materials, workmanship and finish are remarkable for the price.  And more importantly, it plays like a real guitar.  The sound is sweet and round enough that I genuinely enjoy the sound of 5-year-old practicing (!), and after an initial breaking-in period it holds tuning well	pos
I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. I haven't changed anything or done anything.

I was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway. It was a lot of fun! While it worked. We experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here ...

If you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first	neg
These are great fun!  My daughter loves to shake them and sing.  Brightly colored and good quality. They are fun for the whole family and just the right size for small hands.  They are good for play other than just musical, as they can be sorted according to color (if you get more than one) and put into things and taken out again; they lend themselves to hours of fun	pos
I have been a subscriber to Threads since it's inaugural issue, and have saved every one. The publishers, writers and editors have uncompromising standards for accuracy, originality and inspiration. While the magazine has evolved over the years, and away from accessory crafts such as knitting, it has nevertheless remained the premier publication for fine sewing. Some articles are geared towards the advanced sewers, but many basic techniques and information are shown and explained more clearly, in more easy to understand depth, than any other publication of it's type. The pictures and diagrams are professional and clear. The instructions well written. Even the advertising is worth perusing. Top caliber all around	pos
I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys.  With Tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released. ---  --- Now, while there are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save Mes."  The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it.  It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus.  Considering Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around, drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong.  It doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had. ---  --- Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of Jayhawks throw-aways	neg
I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit. The maps look good although i havn't noticed much change from version 2005. There are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated. A little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going. It has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use. The phonebook is very nice!	pos

Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).  ---  --- If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. --- And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.	neg

I got the dreaded "E18" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year.  Repairs will be at least $100, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS...even if the exact same problem occurs again!

My first PhotoShot broke after about a year and a half, and since I liked the ease of use and basic design, I chalked it up to bad luck and bought another.  Big mistake	neg

We bought this camera because our other digital camera (SONY DSC-H1) was too large to carry around a lot of the time. We took it skiing with us (Whistler, BC) and it took some outstanding pictures, both of persons and of landscape/scenery. It is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere, anytime. Others may disagree, but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive. Fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed (or better yet, use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers, that doesn't leave any marks on the screen). To summarize: this is an excellent camera, very small size but with a large 3" LED display, takes EXCELLENT pictures, and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive. Most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it. The only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder, but unless you have very bright sun at your back this isn't too much of a problem.	pos
These were so delicious! They gave a great variety of cakes. When I say cakes, I mean in the sense that they're little asian rice balls filled with sweet bean paste, either mung bean or red bean. They're yummy and light. I didn't care for the strawberry/grape jelly cakes, they seemed like fillers, but the rest tasted good. Refridgerate thm after a day if you don't eat them immediately. They might dry out if you leave them in the box.	pos
I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion, however, the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn't seem to go with anything including jeans.

You want to loose that gut, build muscles everywhere and become a lethal adversary all at the same time? Then get a punching bag and pair of gloves. To be honest the hardest part is getting the bag to stay on the hook without pulling out your ceiling every few days. You need to consult a hardware store for the right bolt fitting. Getting this right is half the battle. When you have finally managed to find the right bolt type for your ceiling then you are on your way to becoming somebody else! 10 minutes a day will make you a mean lean machine within two months, guaranteed. Start by looking for the boxing posture on the internet. Take up this basic stance and learn to throw punches while protecting your face with the other glove. Tuck that chin in. You will cut your knuckles, even with gloves on, but these wounds will heal and soon you will find your hands hardening up with each blow. Move around the bag and make those strikes count each time. Feel the punch and try to avoid awkward possible wrist breaking miss-strikes that you don't want to make. Within a few days you will find yourself building up a quicker pace. Everyday your arms will be firmer and your muscles bigger. Your hands will become stronger. Take off the gloves at the end of the punching workout and try chopping the bag with the base of the hand, directly under the thumb with the thumb stretched out and the elbow bent. Strike downwards and sideways with the palm facing down, never up. Harden up those chop areas of the hands. Now when you have built up some nice chopping combos without gloves and boxing combos with gloves, it is time to throw in some elbow blows. Move that hand in towards your chest and strike just above the elbow with each arm. Twist that body and harden up those areas on both arms. Start striking with elbows, gloves or chops in whatever order you want. Build up a rhythm to your workout and soon you will be throwing twenty move combos at the bag. You will stun yourself. Now the next step is either to take up a proper boxing course for correction or go study some manuals on Close Quarter Combat. It beats most of the far east martial arts by using some brute force quick knockdown strategies. Try "Get Tough" by W. E. Fairbairn for starters. Rubber knives are also good. Learn the strategy in "Kill or Get Killed" by Rex Applegate. Keep up with the sport boxing and learn these powerful World War II Trench Warfare Close Quarter Combat manoeuvres for self defence. And it all starts right here with the bag. Bag owners simply have the power	pos
Hank Chinaski can't hold a job, can't hold a woman, can't control his alcoholism, and can't make a decent friend because he wallows with the dregs of society.  Chinaski is the lowest of the semi-functioning drunks, barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor. ---  --- Unfortunately, the movie doesn't hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people.  Chinaski's struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into.  There's no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism.  The closest he comes to poetics, IMHO, is where he tells his ex-boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk. ---  --- 'Factotum' is saved only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn Matt Dillon (Hank), Lili Taylor (Jan), and Marisa Tormei (Laura) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene.  The script is stilted, without any highs or lows to it.  The movie isn't near as fatalistic as 'Leaving Las Vegas', or as hard hitting as 'Requiem For A Dream', and without any of the comedic relief from 'Spun'.  The closest comparison would be the jaw-stretching yawn-fest of 'Drunks'. ---  --- Even if you love addiction movies like I do, or love Dillon or Tormei, that still isn't enough to recommend this movie.  If curiosity overcomes you as it did me, then rent the movie before buying it.  It's earned two stars for the acting alone.  Have a ball or something else to play with if you rent this, it's that boring.  	neg
For those of you who have not yet read this book: this book is about a white-wannabe black girl who pays way too much attention to her friend's puberty. I have never read a worse book in my life. This book is shallow, boring, and completely pointless	neg
We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency. --- When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep.  --- We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!	neg
This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of. ---  --- Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of "production notes" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.  ---  --- All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster.	neg
There's a reason why they talk about the "Voice of an Angel" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut "I'll Be There" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so. ---  --- Seventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl. ---  --- The problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps. ---  --- "I'll Be There" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because "I'll Be There" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting. ---  --- With a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills.  ---  --- The best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church. ---  --- Miss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. "I'll Be There," but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can	neg
My wife bought 3 of the small children's zithers from Amazon, and none of them were in tune - so I picked up this wonderful and reasonably priced item to put them in tune and good order. --- It is a very simple setup, with easy to follow directions.

I'm not a huge coffee fan -- most of the time, I find it bitter.  Then there's the whole "language" you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints.  But occasionally I do feel like I need that little surge of energy. ---  --- This Kona Blend coffee is the perfect choice.  It has a lot of flavor, but none of the bitterness I find in a lot of other coffees.  This is the one I put in the coffee maker when I plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis.  It makes great iced coffee, too	pos
I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far.  I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time.  It seem quite rugged, and holds a ton!

The only proplem I've had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag, but I was able to fix it.  I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along, but for now, this is perfect	pos
For those who have watched the movie Jaws (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score John Williams did for it. This cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly, with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film. ---  --- The linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information, which gives the overall package a nice touch. The overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent. A highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music	pos

Wow, this l932 camp classic squeezes so much into its running time--S&M, near-nudity, drugs, racism,sex, sex--you're left gasping. Boris Karloff turns in a delightful turn as the menacing Fu Manchu. Myrna  Loy, in her pre-superstar days, is his "horribly ugly" daughter,  who delights in capturing gorgeous hunk, Charles Starrett, and playing with  him like a toy. His nearly nude scenes--when he wears a loose, constantly  shifting diaper--while she runs her long talons over her glistening  torso--must've have accelerated pulses of all sexes back in this pre-Code  extravaganza. Fay Wray should have played Karen Morley's squealing heroine.  Silver-haired and elegant Lewis Stone makes an off-beat hero-adventurer.  Gorgeous photography by Tony Gaudio, comic book costumes by Adrian, art  deco settings by Cedric Gibbons make this a smash-hit from the first frame  to the last. Lots of flesh baring by Charles and the dark slaves. It's fun  to watch Myrna lash her whip over Starrett and her "Nubian"  slaves. Great quote: "Will we ever understand this Eastern race?&quot	pos
I received the XACTi a few weeks ago and it's performing like I hoped it would.  The controls are a very simple and intuitive.  All the required hardware is included.  Does not require any additional software to run on Mac or Windows. ---  --- I have a MacBook with Boot Camp running Windows XP Pro.  The camera works easily with either platform.  It is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive.  I am using a SanDisk 2gb SD memory card. ---  --- Another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with miniDV.  The quality may not be the same as miniDV but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference.  The quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size. ---  --- My old camera was a 2 mega pixel Canon Powershot A60.  This is rated at 6 mega pixel.  You can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies.  When filming movies, the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth, even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers. ---  --- This is my first camcorder so I can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away	pos
I bought this camera to replace a 3MP Kodak CX series when I thought I had lost it.  My 3MP took great pics and I never had any problems with it and I didn't want to have to learn to use a different brands software. ---  --- The Kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when I bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better.  The Kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files. ---  --- I haven't used the C533 a lot since I bought it but the pics I've taken have come out great. But just like the other reviews state, slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries.  However, if you spend the extra money for the Lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life. ---  --- All in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person	pos

Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider.	pos
This is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves, my 2nd pair of this exact Speedo Aqua Fitness Glove.  Allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit.  With other gloves, water builds up inside the glove and, if lycra-backed for example, the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while. ---  --- These Speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes. ---  --- In addition, the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves I have had. The palms hold up well as do the backs. ---  --- I recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises	pos

Phil Jackson groupie and sometime ESPN.com writer Charley Rosen turns in a fun, but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life.  He develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot.  However, Rosen's personal oddities drag the book down.  Rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting, urination, defacation, etc.  At times, the book reads like an immature third grader's delight.  My roommates and I all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable, but Charley Rosen is a really weird guy	neg

This software does not provide even the basic red eye fix.  It turns them a light shade of grey, maybe. It is horrible.  This to me renders it useless.  ---  --- It is for the most basic of users.

Alien invasion stories have been done to death since H.G. Wells gave us The War Of The Worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. Well, William C. Dietz pulls it off with Death Day and the concluding volume Earth Rise. What sets Death Day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all, the invading force being made up of different races. This makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new, different and engaging. Also, using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true, and tragic, note. The surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders and horde resources. The aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on Earth. And, sadly, collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. But the seeds of rebellion have been planted. Humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. All this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Dietz is the best SF writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting. 	pos

It is, in my opinion, the second best Anne book! Its Anne's wedding! The whole thing is soaked in romance! Leslie's story is so amazing and sweet that you have to love her. Captain Jim is so sweet and perfect, you can nearly see him. Miss Cornelia is funny and Susan is great. Anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful. The only thing I don't like, is that i wish Marrilla and all the Avonlea people would be in it a little more. In my opinion, this should be where the series ends	pos

VCI's budget DVD starts out well enough for the obscure thriller Lady Ice, with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come. Unfortunately, as soon as the credits end, the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs I've ever seen on DVD. Pass on this one from VCI, and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits.	neg

Noah Webster's book is fascinating reading for today's students and teachers alike, as well as for the average citizen, as there is much to learn from it.  While it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an  official school text, it certainly has a place in every school library.   One of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used,  with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and  consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress.  It also  spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be  ignored in modern teaching.  The terminology of traditional grammar is  used, and there are copious word lists, with words grouped according to  common factors. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all  students of the English language for the above reasons and for many other  interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases;  abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc).  This book should remain a  spelling classic	pos

THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.  ---  --- This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role. ---  --- Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen).  ---  --- By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother. ---  --- Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray. ---  --- Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original. 	neg
I purchased this watch for my 7 year old son. It is a eye catching and because it's Lego, it was an instant hit.

my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer, they were all gone, and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here, it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor, but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back	neg

We bought our youngest son the pirate ship seven years ago when he was four. He is now eleven, and is asking for this new updated ship. He has played with the old one for years, outside in the pool, inside, along with the big king castle, and countless other sets that we have. Yes, Playmobil. is delicate, and young children can be taught how to play with it, there are alot of small pieces, but like Lego, it will and does encourage a child's imagination, rather than stifle it.  We have Castles, western forts, city sets, boats, all of it! It does take time to put together, but some of the best memories are of me and my boys putting together some of these intricate playmobil sets the day after Christmas! When you buy toys for your kids, don't look at a toy and say "what does it do", rather look at a toy and ask "what can my child do with this toy"? Playmobil has been one of the toys that my three boys have stayed with along with legos well past Christmas, much more, than anything else. I am keeping all of our collections for our grandchildren.   	pos
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched. --- The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration). ---  --- However, I do have a few things to complain about... ---  --- First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine. ---  --- Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up. ---  --- The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room. ---  --- The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot. ---  --- These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice. 	pos

I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray.  Trying to outsmart him, I purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl.  Much to my disappointment, they only stick to the formica countertops well.  The littlest one doesn't even stick to that.  None of them stays on my son's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two. ---  --- On the upside, the lids are secure once shut all the way (which can take a little work), so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag...I haven't had one leak yet, and I put things like applesauce in them to test them.  Not a total waste of money, now that I found this alternate use.  They wash well, without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic, on the top rack of the dishwasher	neg

 --- VISTA is appropriated named.  VISTA defines something great to look at.  If all you did was look at Microsoft Vista it would be the perfect operating system indeed.  Unfortunately Vista is a computer operating system that was designed to be used and there is the problem.  Vista is so secure and so over burdened with layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer of sheer garbage it is rendered totally completely and utterly useless. ---  --- Vista will take the fastest XP computer and turn it into a slow worthless pile of trash.  Vista is so slow it takes me back to the days when I used to walk away from my IBM AT computer get a cup of coffee and walk around the building.  What makes Vista worse still is Microsoft Office 2007 the absolute pits in word processing.  Add Office 2007 to Vista and you won't be productive at all but dang won't it look pretty. If you just want to watch your computer make pretty colors and areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch Vista.  When you want to work and be productive turn on your XP computer.  Windows 2000 and XP work hard while Vista Hardly Works at all.  Vista is garbage don't buy this dreck! ---  --- Everything you try to do on Vista is not allowed.  Almost every peice of equipment you run on Vista needs to be updated to so called Vista friendly versions.  The messed up Windows explorer to the point to where it is beyond useless.  The problem with Vista is that Microsoft had taken all the wizards and helpful features far as they could in XP.  In Vista they had to try to top a operating system that pretty much did what you asked of it with little fuss.  In Vista the software code writers were just changing things because they could.  Vista makes nothing better or easier.  In fact Vista is built in a manner that almost seems to go out of its way to make even the most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring and tedious. ---  --- In a word TEDIOUS IS THE BEST SINGLE WORD TO DESCRIBE MICROSOFT WINDOWS VISTA.  VISTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THE ENTIRE COMPUTER EXPERIENCE IS PAINFULLY NEW LEVEL OF THE PURELY TEDIOUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DREAMT OF BEFORE!  I just wish I could give Vista no stars or more honestly a negative star rating.  I won't be buying Vista for my current systems and even when I get a new computer I will not be using Vista is it comes pre installed.  I have my own old trusty XP disks and I will reinstalled XP the last useful usable operating system Microsoft made. ---  --- XP is the goofy kiddie skool like interface is ugliest operating system Microsoft ever made but while it was an ugly duckling it did work pretty well.  Vista is by far the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever made but it is pretty and dumb.  Vista is over burdened with programmatic junk has a way to high opinion of itself.  Vista is so much more secure because all the dumb security features make the operating system unusable.  Any computer you make unusable is the most secure because you can't do any productive work on it.  Vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious and makes your computer system a must see door stop.  The philosophy of Vista seems to be that a good computer should be seen but never productively used.  Vista is a great system for that  well monied executive that wants to look busy while doing nothing productive	neg

This product will not work for everyone. It's not really for people with straight, fine hair.  It's formulated to target mostly women of color who have tightly curled, thick, natural hair.  I apply about a nickle-size of this stuff to the ends of my hair before I style it. It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and conditioned - eliminating breakage so that it can grow long and healthy. The aroma is a little too earthy for my personal taste, but I can handle that as long as the natural ingredients work. I give it 5 stars	pos

I bought this product b/c I can't stand the feeling of hair/stubble on my legs. I got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave. This product indicated I could remove hair in about the same amount of time, but that it would last much longer than shaving. I purchased it and waited a week to receive it. Once I received it, I spent 40 minutes using it. In this time, I could have shaved both legs, both underarms, and my bikini line twice. Using this product, I was not even done with one leg. I went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period, and it did not remove a single hair. I pressed lightly, I pressed hard, I did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach, and nothing made this product work as indicated. Others may have had luck with it, but I did not. I was not impressed and I would not recommend it to anyone.	neg

First, this piece of trash is based on The Journey To The West about as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on the Bible. There are some characters common to both Lost Empire and Journey. Well, common in name. That said let's get to the real problem with this film. It is astoundingly insulting to Chinese religious traditions. Imagine for a moment some non-Christian producing a film in which: the God Jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to Satan; Jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power; and the Virgin Mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars. Sound offensive? It is. And this film is equally insulting to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism (the three big ones in China). --- Confucius, a man revered these past 2500 years for his uncompromising moral standards appears in Lost Empire as a lecherous,traitorous,lying,cowardly weasel. --- The Jade Emperor,Taoism's chief God, is shown as a despondent,apathetic slob who no longer cares about the earthly or celestial realms. --- Kuan Yin, one of the Bodhisattvas, is shown in Lost Empire falling in romantic and physical love with a man. That is as likely as the Virgin Mary turning tricks on a street corner. --- If some religious bigot wanted to disguise a piece of anti-Chinese propaganda as a clever adventure-fantasy they could not easily do better than The Lost Empire. It makes me wonder if the insult was intended.	neg
I bought this monitor because it was affordable and I thought it would be an easier and faster way to check my BP regularly.

If you want a deep gloss, a smooth finish, and paint protection, then you will love the NXT. But be advised, the NXT paste, is a better product than the liquid. They both give the same look, but the paste seems to last longer, because liquid have more solvants in them. The paste is not hard to use at all, and the secret is to ues a very Small amount. If you try caking it on, you will have a hard time getting it off, and you will end up with streaks. I have a silver frost Lincoln Town car, and the NXT brings out the metal flake in the paint. The car looks as good as it did when it was new, and it is currently three years old. The cost is a littie on the high side, but don't forget, if you want the best look, and protection, it wil cost you a little more. If you just want wax, get a bottle of a less expencive product ans call it a day. If you want the best look your can have, then use the NXT. YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULTS	pos

This is currently my absolute favorite scent. I get so discouraged when smell somthing in a store love it, buy it, take it home and put it on, and smells completely different on me. I have never had that problem with this scent. it's smells delicious in the bottle and on the skin, that is if you like citrus. It smells like a fresh, ripe Orange, with the slightest hint of spice. The man in my life finds it quite cuddle worthy. If you are not familiar with perfume oils, just somthing to note. they are highly concentrated, a little goes a long way. it also phases nicely, from intense to pleasently subtle and is long lasting. Another bonus is that there are only few ingredients, so it's less likely to irritate sensitive skin. One bottle will last and last, there is a flexable applicator wand inside the lid. I really can't say enough about this wonderful fragrance	pos

The Hand of Fear is not top-notch, all-time classic Who. Even producer Philip Hinchcliffe doesn't like it very much. The only reason it was likely selected for DVD release over such classics as The Seeds of Doom or Terror of the Autons is probably because it's Sarah Jane's farewell story. Many stories during the Hinchcliffe/Holmes years of Who, sometimes referred to as the "golden age" of Doctor Who, sometimes referred as the "gothic horror period," were based on movies. The Seeds of Doom was based on The Day of the Triffids. Horror of Fang Rock was based on And Then There Were None. If not based on an actual film, many were "inspired" in general by the look and feel of the Hammer horror films. The Hand of Fear was inspired by The Hands of Dr. Orlac, the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a killer. The story starts out great, beginning with a fantastic in-joke. Rock quarries were VERY frequently used in the program as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien planets. Here the Doctor and Sarah land in a rock quarry on earth, and Sarah thinks they're on an alien planet! After an accident with a detonation, Sarah finds Eldrad's hand, and starts saying she/he/it must live a lot. "Eldrad must! live" (high note on "must"). She takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it can start absorbing energy and regenerating. The story thus far is excellent, and Sarah Jane, possessed by Eldrad, is genuinely creepy, though why she's dressed as Andy Pandy I'll never know. Extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker disappears with the hand into the core. Also extremely effective is Eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power plant's core, and then slowly emerging. The show goes downhill quick once Eldrad, Doctor and co. head to Eldrad's planet. Producer Hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked a certain punch. I agree. For some reason, once Eldrad is back on its home planet the story loses all its edge. Furthermore, Sarah's farewell seems entirely forced. The Hand of Fear, overall, is still good stuff though, and is well worth owning. It is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the Tardis interior. (Why they didn't stick with the awesome Jules Verne-ish interior I have no idea!)	pos
Perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in English (or at least it appears to have been, there is no translator listed), but this is by far the most lucid thing I've read by Latour. In a way it's a radical break, he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child Actor Network Theory, stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work.	pos
I bought my girls, ages 7 and 4, this product earlier this spring. It was easy to assemble, but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process.  It has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use. When our play group meets here, the kids line up to have a turn, over and over again.  I would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands.

Harper's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest American- writers , from Mark Twain on down. Its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist Lewis Lapham. It publishes fiction, and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of American economic, political and cultural life. It attracts the big - names in all areas, and also provides a lot of human - interest material, statistical curiosities, historical information and stories. --- For some reason which I do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite. And in the old days I preferred 'the Atlantic' and the 'Saturday Review of Literature ' to it. Of course one of the features of 'Harper's is its book- reviews done by among others today, John Leonard.  --- I suppose what has soured me a bit on 'Harper's' is its bias to the political left. --- But that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality	pos

When you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the `70's generation you're talking about Paddy Chayefsky's brilliantly written black comedy, `The Hospital' which was released in `70. ---  --- A contemporary, dysfunctional, urban hospital serves as the microcosm of America's failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century, but the mental and emotional illnesses as well. George C. Scott stars in the role of Dr. Herbert Bock, hospital administrator. Dr. Bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity. His wife has left him, he's estranged from his children and he's in the grips of a mid-life crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question. When a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff Dr. Bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad. ---  --- With great performances by George C. Scott and the lovely Brit Diana Rigg, `The Hospital' is a thought-provoking film that will elicit discussion and debate. Watch it with a friend	pos

For any of you teachers out there who plan to watch this in your classroom with your students:  BEWARE!!  First of all, I've heard of taking "liberties" with a book but this is ridiculous!

Nine months ago I was hired to help turnaround a once successful business.  From day one I realized that this was a company without focus.  It's one thing to define a problem, another to find a solution.  Haneberg's book was a shot in the arm.  Just one concept -- "Stop Multitasking" -- would have been a major breakthrough for my team.  And, personally, the idea of doing "One Great Thing" has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job.  This book immediately rose to the rank of three or four "must read" titles in my business library.  In the couple of months since I first read it (and I've re-read it a couple of times) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions -- we're nailing deadlines, we're closing more sales, we're thinking more strategically across the board.  In a business and social environment that throws more at us day-by-day, hour-by-hour, this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago.  We're all doing more with less -- and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities.  If it's true, as Woody Allen says, that 98% of success is showing up, then the other 2% is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there.

     This film's predecessor,"Ginger Snaps 2--Unleashed," was a competent but uninspired effort: a typical sequel.  In contrast, "Ginger Snaps Back" is a significant film--but hardly a sequel at all. ---      The first two "Ginger Snaps" installments took place in contemporary Canada, mainly in suburbs and city; but "Ginger Snaps Back" is set in the Canadian frontier wilderness of nearly 200 years ago.  Furthermore, in the earlier films (particularly the first) the two sisters Brigitte and Ginger share a complex relationship--loving but mutually antagonistic: Ginger's cynical death wish keeps her at odds with Brigitte who would stay alive (and human!) at any cost.  In "Ginger Snaps Back," however, the girls have been simplified: they've become fairy tale orphans wandering through a monster-infested forest. ---      Early on in the film, the sisters find shelter in a militaristic fort/outpost run by some very hard guys--misfit toughs who resemble ogres just waiting for victims to approach their lonely castle!  Significantly, it's in this dubious refuge that Ginger is infected with lycanthropy.  Thus with monsters lurking outside the gates as well as within, the film plunges toward a fiery but despairing climax. ---      Overall, "Ginger Snaps Back" conveys a thrilling atmosphere of folklore and legends--an ancient eeriness more easily felt than described.  Even the film's snow-covered forests radiate a sense of centuries-old Indian myths; appropriately, the film's Indian characters, including a larger-than-life hunter/warrior, identify the werewolves with the wendigo. ---      As a work of folklore or fairy tale, "Ginger Snaps Back" tends to be less verbal, but more visionary than the preceding films in this trilogy.  Startling, beautiful images abound in this movie.  Just one example: lovely Ginger in her black hooded cloak, with vamp fangs and raptor claws, flinging open the gates of the fort to admit the besieging werewolves.  As the creatures surge forward and around her, Ginger stands as an icon of demonic ecstasy--comparable to the robot doppelganger in Fritz Lang's great "Metropolis"!  Of course, that comparison alone should indicate the imaginative power flowing through "Ginger Snaps Back.	pos

I would like to classify myself as a moderate but I probably lean conservative.  Because of that, I subscribed to Harpers so that I could read good writing that would challenge my beliefs and stretch my mind in new ways.  I got that, more or less, at first, but over the course of a couple of years the magazine drifted further and further to a leftist propaganda screed, the worst of which was Louis Lapham's bitter drivel editorials.  It got to a point where the writing was incredibly predictable; I knew exactly what position (read:  left of Pelosi) the writer--any writer in Harpers--would take on whatever the issue was, and I had a pretty good idea of what the line of whining would be. ---  --- If you attend dinner parties on the Upper East Side; if you drive a Prius to the Oscars; if you think commercial organic farming is an environmental travesty; if you've ever desecrated a Starbucks, then look no more--this magazine is for you.   ---  --- However, if you're dumbfounded at how the Republicans can keep winning elections--and then you realize they have the Democratic party as opponents; if you realize the genius of George Bush and Karl Rove is in getting liberals to underestimate George Bush and Karl Rove; if you want to read smart, insightful writing that will inform and entertain, then try The Atlantic Monthly (which, by the way, I am surprised to see reviewers describe as a liberal magazine; I think it is moderate, and if anything, a bit on the conservative side.)   Needless to say, I let my Harpers subscription lapse. ---  --- Two stars, tho, for the Harper's Index--however, that wasn't worth the price of a subscription (it got to be the only thing worth anything for the price of the subscription).  	neg

Worked alright for a few months.  I wasn't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls.  I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads.  It didn't.   ---  --- The bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn't easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used.  Never again	neg
this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall, and my first review here at amazon as well... these matcha candies get better and better with each one- i can see how they could become quite addictive! individually wrapped and matcha powder coated, this flavor takes some getting used... the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder, and then the inside is all chewy and decadent- YUMMY - actually, i think i'm already addicted!! also, nice to travel with or put in your bag- these won't melt or make a mess.	pos
I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day! ---  --- It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily. ---  --- You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...	pos

This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.   ---  --- Also, I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription, as the water will magnify things. ---  --- 	pos
This is my favorite production of the ALICE books.  I love the sets, songs, and casting. It's also very British, which I think adds another great element to the mix. ---  --- However, skip this DVD edition.  I got it, excited to see ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND in widescreen and, perhaps a better print than what's previously been available. ---  --- No such luck. ---  --- The DVD appears to be struck from the same crappy VHS version that's been out there for ages.  Faded colors. Pan-and-scan. In this age of DVD, quality like this is such a shame	neg

Whenever I think of the Second World War, the two places I usually think about in terms of carnage is the Eastern Front; and the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The other is the Pacific Campaign between the USA and Japan. One of the reviewers wrote, "I'm glad the Russian Won." So am I. And what a bloody war it was. The number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe [except Asia] seem pale in comparison. The Russians suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and the German army paid one hell of a steep price. ---  --- Also, it was in the east where the Germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind. It was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of Jews: The German  program of the 'Final Solution.' Everything I have ever read about the  Second World War concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind-boggling. It's as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last. This documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies. From Barbarossa to Berlin, it is one of the best documenatries out there. At least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front. I don't believe this is the definitive documentary, as more and more information is being released now that the Soviet Union is no more. But for now, I highly recommend this film. [Stars: 4.5]    	pos
Being sick and tired of shaving constantly and buying expensive blades, I did some research and decided to try an epilator.  I figured I'd give this model a try. I have not been disappointed!  Yes, it hurt the first time I used it--I hadn't shaved in almost a week and I had a lot of thick dark hair.  But, it was pulling it right out.  The more you use it, the less it hurts. I haven't had ugly, rough stubble since. I also like that Panasonic has included a shaver head--this works great to trim up too-long hairs before epilation or for the more sensitive areas that are just too painful to epilate.  The heads are easily interchangable and a snap to clean.  This is a great all-around epilator/shaver.   	pos
This is a FABULOUS gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures.  Just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable, probably since the product is new.  Don't bypass their software to load the pix if you're transferring from your PC to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one. And even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same, it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time	pos
I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times. --- I quit playing it pretty quickly	neg
I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between "wicca" and "witchcraft".  Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to "chopping" of source materials. This is a waste of money	neg
Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.   Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.	neg
After buying this camera I was pleased for the most part, as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. It's a sleek, smooth design with minimal buttons, thus little confusion. There are 3 things, however, that I'm not happy with. One is that it takes double A batteries, and eats them up REALLY fast. The second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder, just the LCD screen. The LCD screen is large, which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. You can't turn the LCD screen off, so batteries go fast. The third and final thing I dislike about it is that there's no AC adaptor, so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the TV, not using it to take pictures, you have to run it on batteries. That is, unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt AC plug, which is neither on the Vivitar website, or anywhere else online that I can find made specifically for this camera. I'm a little upset that it came with no adapter, as that would be SO useful for a camera that eats up batteries. I reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera	pos
For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range	pos

I am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original Disgaea. As such I will not get to much into the aspect of gameplay and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note. Having said that, let's begin. ---  --- The game begins in the land of Veldime, an alternate world from that of the first game, where an evil Overlord named Zenon has hidden from well, everyone. When he came into Veldime however, he placed a curse on the land that changed all humans into demons. The effects weren't all immediate as some still have several human qualities but if the curse is not reversed soon, there will be no turning back. Thus the hero Adell (oddly enough the only person unaffected by Zenon's curse) sets out to defeat the Overlord. In the opening there is an attempt to summon Zenon to Adell so he can fight him, but it goes awry and Zenon's daughter accidentally gets summoned instead. Bound to Adell by the summoning pact she has no choice but to accompany him to the castle where he intends to kill her father (albeit not without scheming a bit herself). In a nutshell, the story is good. Nothing amazing but with ample opportunity for the humor most have come to love about the original. ---  --- The only really new additions to the battles are the ability to do Stack Attacks and, if you are quick enough, throw diagnally. The basis of stack attacks are that after building the tower of aliies using the lift command, the person on the bottom of the tower still has the ability to attack. In doing so they begin passing the enemy up the tower with everyone taking a shot at him and then spiking him back to the ground. Essentially, a team attack of up to 10 characters. There have been updates to the Dark Assembly with 6 factions of Senators being introduced. And it can be easier to pass some bills if you are lucky since quite often some senators will show up to vote drunk (random vote basically) or even asleep (no vote at all). Perhaps the most entertaining addition though is felonies. You can recieve a felony for things such as power leveling, having to much hp/sp/mana, or even killing your own allies. The benifit of felonies is that on top of any stat boosts you may get, it is easier to pass proposals at the Dark Assembly, and for every felony on a character they gain 1% extra exp. This works all the way up to 300 felonies (300% exp bonus). ---  --- The game has made all the necessary additions to make the gameplay top that of the original, however in my opinion there feels like something is missing. The characters seem a bit more "by the book" and not as wonderfully absurd as the original. That and the voice acting isn't quite as good as the that of the first Disgaea (plus Etna has a new voice actress...). Despite all of that however, the game plays much better and even looks a bit smoother to boot. All in all it is a great game and a worthy sequel to an amazing game. While some may like the changes in the characters and others may not, there is no denying that the core of the game is much better than the original and will keep you addicted for just as long, if not longer	pos
I had stopped using a regular hair dryer a few of months ago as I felt that my hair was becoming brittle and looking damaged.  However air drying my hair seemed to take forever. It was then that I heard about the T3 tourmaline Professional Ionic Hair Dryer from my hairdresser.  Initially the $200 price tag did put me off and I pushed the idea aside. But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer.  ---  --- And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah... I am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that I don't have to deal with being late for meetings. I   recommend this product to all who would love to have a mane to be proud of	pos
It is a great compact camera with a good zoom.  I can now leave a larger lens on my Nikon DX 70 and use this for closer shots.  YOu do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want. I really like it for most general quick shots, carry it wth me most of the time	pos
If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.  ---  --- When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.  ---  --- The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.  ---  --- Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:  ---  --- Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache  ---  --- Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.  ---  --- Irrésistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.  ---  --- For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.  ---  --- Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.  ---  --- Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.  ---  --- Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.  ---  --- Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.  ---  --- Poésie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.  ---  --- Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.  ---  --- Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.  ---  --- Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.  ---  --- Also Recommended:  ---  --- If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.  ---  --- Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.  ---  --- My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.  ---  --- ~TheRebeccaReview.com	pos

We love the Diaper Dekor and have referred it to many of our friends and family!  It is SUPER simple to use and the refills which seem expensive at first are actually cheaper than other brands because they last for 2-3 months vs. a week (i.e. Diaper Genie)! ---  --- From reading the other reviews, I think I can clear a few things up - it seems these people have been misled hence their problems with this product.  First, there are 2 versions of this pail - a larger called DIAPER DEKOR PLUS and regular size called simply DIAPER DEKOR. Thus, there are 2 different sizes of refills, PLUS and REGULAR.  You can find out which model you have by simply opening the door on the pail - there is a sticker that will have the model on there - if you do not see PLUS anywhere, you will need to buy REGULAR refills - the PLUS will not fit, and vice versa. ---  --- Secondly, the refills are VERY easy to insert, you simply follow the directions which come with the unit.  Basically, you remove the plastic insert, wrap the opened refills from the inside of the insert and around the top - the excess refill wraps around the outside of the plastic and then you sit it in the pail - knot tied in the bottom of the new refill.  If you have a unit, this will make sense - if you haven't bought one yet, I probably just confused you - but you will see once you get it that it is very easy to do! ---  --- Last but not least, the refills that have been on the market for the past year have absolutely no scent at all - I personally would not mind having a baby powder scent but these have no scent.  It's not like I will be sniffing inside the pail or anything, so it doesn't matter - afterall, once the refill is in the pail, NO SCENT will come out - not even dirty diapers! ---  --- Unfortunately, it seems these few reviewers who gave this product a poor rating were misinformed by store workers and their poor review actually had nothing to do with the product but rather frustration stemming from unknowledgable employees at baby stores.  I hope this has helped!  We've had this unit for nearly a year and absolutely swear by it!  It is a GODSEND!  No smells and how much easier can you get than just dropping a diaper into the pail and not having to do another thing!  Not many other units will allow you to store up to 3 weeks of diapers without a single scent	pos
This is beautiful birdbath.  If placed on solid ground (walkway, concrete) it will be great. However, if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom.  A wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip.  However, it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright.  I am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch	pos
I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.	neg
All the positive comments you read here about this film are true.  ---  --- This classic western stars John Wayne, Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey Jr, along with a great supporting cast lead by Ward Bond -- the usual John Ford suspects. Ford strikes a balance between action and sentimentality, directing this simple story in a straightforward fashion with a great sense of style. This is Ford's first color film and cinematography by Winton C. Hoch looks really, really rich and with enough sand to make you wish you had some lemonade.  ---  --- Duke really shines in this film -- just watch those expressions. ---  --- Restored to its original pristine 1948 35mm real Technicolor glory, "3 Godfathers" is a natural for the Christmas season. This heartwarming drama is a gritty, tender, timeless classic. A film the whole family can watch. ---  --- This sleeper film in the WB/MGM catalog was way, W A Y overdue on DVD in the US. But here it is, most welcomed and highly recommended! ---  --- (I've revised my original 2003 review to reflect this title's availability on DVD. Released with zero fanfare, I was first aware of its release when I saw a newspaper ad for it one week before Christmas 2005.	pos
I am a novice at web page creating and I am OVERLY glad I tried the free web trial (of course I lied about my address and my first born etc. that you MUST give to just get the so called "FREE" trial) this is the WORST web page editor for not so with it people.

All bow down to the producers at Criterion, who have done an outstanding job of bringing to DVD one of the best Rock films ever made, GIMME SHELTER.  The film itself has been reviewed to death over the past thirty years, so I won't do that here.  I will, however, let 'cha know that beyond Criterion's beautiful, vibrant, remixed, remastered presentation lies a world of wonderful extras: 1) commentary by filmmakers Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, 2) audio material from the four-hour day-after program  broadcast by KSAN on December 7, 1969, 3) three different trailers for the film, 4) trailers for other Maysles Brothers films, 5) 5.1, 2.0 stereo and DTS sound mixes, 6) outtake footage including performances of "Oh, Carol" and a nice acoustic "Prodigal Son", 7) a studio mixing session with the band for "Little Queenie", 8) an extensive stills gallery, 9) a HUGE book with much material on the film and the filming, and lots more.  GIMME SHELTER is a must-own for your video Rock library.  Thank you, Criterion	pos
Nintendo hasmaintained their status as one of the most successful video game companies ever. Since they hit it big back in the 80's, they've maintained to be as synonomous with the way we play video games just as Microsoft has IBM has maintained the computers. A couple of years ago, Nintendo revolutionary changed the way we play video games with the DS handheld system. Not only has it worked very well, but it has changed the way we played video games with the touch of a pen. Earlier this year, the company redesigned the system with the DS Lite. Now, it has been remade, and it is pretty in pink. ---  --- The Nintendo DS Lite in Coral Pink, is a video game system not only designed for the hard core gamer, but the color makes it have a femanine touch for female gamers too, from its detailed color to its elequent pink-colored stylus. The screen is very crisp and clear, and deliver beautifully in its display. The graphics are crisper and clearer than the original DS system on so many different titles from New Super Mario Brothers, the action-packed puzzler Meteos, and new games like Star Fox Command and Mario Hoops 3-on-3. Not only that, but if you're a fan of Game Boy Advance games, you can play your GBA games on the system as well. The gameplay is crisper and delivers the best control, for the system, but also a easier way to play games that original DS owners had trouble tackling. ---  --- All in all, the Nintendo DS Lite is a great video game system because it is inexpensive and convient for the die hard gamer in not just the price, but the games too. I love this system a whole lot, and if you have the desire to own a video game system, I definitely recommend this one for everyone. ---  --- Graphics: A ---  --- Sound: A ---  --- Control: A ---  --- Fun & Enjoyment: A ---  --- Price: A ---  --- Overall: A 1/2	pos

I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.     ---  ---    I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.

It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.	neg

Talk about taking the joy out of an experience.  I read this book prior to a week-long trip to Venice.  This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives.  It is a poor "guidebook" and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue.  The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres.  The only upside is that it is short.  Yuck, what a waste of time.  My advice is:  get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book.  At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails.  Actually, in terms of a travelogue, "Vendela in Venice" far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.

The red and green dot is MUCH more visible then my brother in law more expensive BSA also.  --- About the manufacture website, it is a 40mm. Dont know why they said 30mm. But like some sight, the lens (both front and back) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up/down/left/right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly. Overall, it worked great. I can tease/tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them.	pos
My only experience with this product was after I opened it, and started to play a DVD in my Xbox, when I tried to pause it, it didn't work, and it had brand new batteries. I found (after much frustration) that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes. I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit, but it was sold out so I just got my money back. You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	neg
Based on other reviews here and comparisons to Jellyfish, Jason Falkner and the Beatles, I was expecting a lot better.  Instead I find this work very shrill and hard to listen to.  Is the guy talented musically?  Yes.  But his voice is mediocre and his songs really don't do it for me.  Sorry but I feel the need to give an honest assessment so others won't be mislead by the breathless reviews here.  I am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre	neg

Purchased these for my husband. He absolutely loves these sandals. He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange. However, he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard. He uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors. Wears them every day. Thanks for a nice slip-on! Also these are sturdy though very light weight	pos
The Park Smart Mats work, that is if your're a good aim.  Really these mats need to be about twice as wide.  The mats are about a foot wide and as you are pulling up to them you can not see them because the hood of your vehicle blocks your view.  Consequently,if you're not lined up perfectly you'll drive right past them.  That being said, they're still the best non-electronic item on the market for stoping your car where you want it	pos

this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two's worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day.

It's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive	pos
This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers.  --- Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest. --- Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected. --- After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account. --- So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return.  ---  I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review	neg
Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story. ---  --- Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine	neg

I've owned this smoker for 6 years and have had great success turning out turkeys, pulled pork, ribs, etc. ---  --- Couple of tips that took me some time to work out. ---  --- 1) Cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it. This'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly. You won't have to refill it during the smoking, and it'll prevent the smoker from getting too "wet" inside. When I left it uncovered, I was getting steamed meat, not smoked. ---  --- 2) Drill a hole in the bottom of the unit, and get a drip pan underneath it. This'll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust. ---  --- 3) Get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element. Makes cleanup much easier, and gets the heat reflected up to the food. ---  --- Have fun...	pos

So what kind of movie is this from the director of "I know what you did last summer?" It's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function. Deep down, Venom is just another teen slasher movie. They rode into this film with the same clichéd scares, a young group of teens, a psycho killer, and a traditional ending.  ---  --- So is it worth seeing?  ---  --- That I can't completely answer for you. If you like more of the same old, then it's probably going to be a blast. The filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane, overused plot. I found some parts to be slightly unpredictable, and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film. The voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply "an unstoppable evil force." ---  --- But individually, do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece? Quite frankly, in my opinion at least....no.  Let's take a look at some of them; ---  --- Acting- Well done, well directed too I might add. The acting is realistic to a degree, and brings us into the film. The actors responded (for the most part) realistically to the story line and I think that this was set-up nicely. The major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead, not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo.  ---  --- Lighting- Dim, dark and mysterious; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film. Combined with the swamp-like location, I think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful.  ---  --- Special Effects- They set this up pretty well. A few scenes made me cringe and I felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it...or bled them out for it. The gore wasn't excessive, but just right for a slasher film, and props to the director for making that call. My only qualm with this is that they used the standard Halloween "stage blood" which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color. A few of the actors squirm around in it, only to look like they're rolling around in pizza sauce. There are a few other tacky special effects, including the last major one in the film.  ---  --- The Killer- Mr. Jangles....? Enough said...sounds like a dog. I'll give the killer credit for being a good actor, but the portrayal needed a lot of work. The make-up kicked it up a notch, but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts didn't do it justice. The man looked like an athlete and moved like one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits. Although I don't specifically know what that looks like....I'm sure they don't run like football players. ---  --- So what overall? It's ok. Not something I'd be dying to see, and I'm glad that I didn't run to the theatre to catch the first showing. It has some good moments and some bad, but doesn't really stand out from any normal Hollywood production.  ---  --- My recommendation?  ---  --- It's ok. I'd rather go rent Containment instead; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind. It's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again...	neg
Am totally dissatisfied with ths wagon as it came dented.  The wagon is shipped in a cardboard box with no styrofoam or other packing - the wagon bed absorbs any impacts.  The parts are in the bed and there is cardboard to prevent scratching - there were no scratches and the finsih was nice.  The pacaging is totally inadequate.  I would return the wagon if time permitted.  I am glad that I am not giving it to a child as a gift.  Buy it where you can look it over first to be sure it's not damaged	neg
I think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do: are they merely to present facts/ideas/personalities/images with no comment, no moralizing, no personal ulterior motives (leaving all those things to the viewer), or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction (which the viewer can then accept or reject)? ---  --- Martin Sheen is Kit, a garbageman working in South Dakota; he becomes friends with 15-year-old Holly (Sissy Spacek). When her father tells Sheen he doesn't want him near his daughter again, Sheen kills him. The two run off together, living for a while in the woods like two "innocents" of some primitive society. But then they're discovered by three men and Sheen kills them, too.  ---  --- They now head for Montana, Sheen committing more murders along the way. He is empty inside, nothing fazes him; he imagines he's like James Dean - misunderstood, alienated. But he doesn't have a clue what he should be alienated against, and as far as being misunderstood, he never once gives the least hint there is anything there TO understand. We finish watching the movie feeling as empty as Sheen. I also felt a little angry at Malick's attempt to con me into thinking there is more to Sheen's vapid character than there really is: he truly is just a non-entity who kills half a score of innocent people.  ---  --- So back to my first paragraph. Malick obviously works from the perspective of the first half of my question posed (a view that became an obsession, I think, with artists, writers, film-makers, etc. beginning in the late 1960s); I tend toward believing the second half.

OK, so this is the 2nd Philosophy product that I've tried and felt the need to write a review on. I have to say, this product is far below expectations.

This book focuses on a cogent question by way of a true story and invites response from all sorts of people with pertinent experience, providing biographies of these respondents. The topic is forgiveness.

I am eager to discuss it with members of my theology group.	pos
I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib. I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots. So in figuring this would also be good for travel, I bought it. My son loves it! The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair. I put it together in about 8 seconds. The removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft. The entire thing is easy to wipe clean. It looks comfy. It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs. and 52 inches. (Good to know) My favorite feature is how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared to other cots. Not nearly as bulky, too! Nice royal Blue colors	pos

Let's Learn Kanji is systematic, it gives you a wealth of basic kanji knowledge (including stroke order and radicals) as well as providing space to practice AND regular worksheets/mini tests so you can monitor your progress! Often kanji books offer only examples and written explanations, or focus soley on repeated written practice. The addition of the mini tests for consolidating your learning makes this book a must have. I studied some kanji previously but found my self directed study slow. While I agree with the other reviewer that the pace seem stedious at first, I after a month I can claim some serious progress! My only concern with this text is that from time to time the mini tests do not have an answer key. All in all an excellent book for self study by motivated beginners	pos
After trying just about every other pricier wiper blade on the market, and being disappointed every time, I decided to spring the extra money for this one (no, they are not cheap) and see if paying the extra money made all that much of a difference. I only bought one initially, on a rainy day when my driver side wiper had flown off the car on my way to work, and then immediately ran back and got one for the passenger side, too, after I'd only gone a mile down the road. These wipers are incredible. I swear my windshield looks better now than it ever has. No smearing, no streaking, and complete water removal. They also work better at removing bugs from the windshield in conjunction with the car window washer fluid than any other wiper I've ever used. Now I'm curious about the longevity of the wiper blade. I'm hoping they last longer than others, too (given the price.	pos
As a Social Worker in private psychotherapy practice, I find that sometimes the work can be isolating and at times I question whether I should make more of an effort to consider the latest trends in psychotherapy. Mary Pipher affirms that the classic skills that make a good therapist such as compassion, empathy, listening skills, reframing and the ability to induce a sense of calm are timeless. Furthermore, even if I wasn't a therapist I think I would still devour this book because her writing is a pleasure to read. I highly recommend it for anyone just starting their career in therapy or those who have been in the field for decades. This book is bound to become a classic	pos

I stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago, having nothing better to do I watched it. My first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens. I was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot. You don't have to be stoned, or even a stoner to enjoy this movie. One reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it. Well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film, like your actualy there, scrapping through life with the characters. I guess I can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie, not enough bells and whisels, but if your up for something differnt give it a try. by the way, the movie was based on a book of the same name, also very good and differnt	pos
Falling in Love is one of my favorite scents ever.  It's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  If you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  That's why I was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  Let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. When I opened the seal and held it under my nose I could hardly smell it.  When I applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  I rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  I expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  Very disappointing. 	neg
I love W magazine in all its oversized glory. Its frothy with articles for the affluent, gorgeous photography, celebrity interviews and other frothy delights.

If anyone works hard for their success then why should they be abashed for enjoying the good life and beautiful things? Its these people that W addresses, and its frothy and I'm going to enjoy it for all its frothiness	pos
This is the 7th Olympus camera I've owned over the years, from film to digital.  I have always been very pleased with Olympus cameras and their usual superior optics.  This camera, though, is a major disappointment, mainly because even though it can shoot in RAW, there is no compatible conversion available yet, leaving you unable to process RAW images.  This renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in JPEG.  Olympus should have ensured that vendors such as Adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible RAW conversion Plug-ins available before this camera hit the market.  There's no excuse for Olympus to not have made sure this was the case, indeed it's downright irresponsible. ---  --- Having said the above, the camera lens is quite nice, the camera itself operates well.  You can take quite good pictures.  However, the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken----if you're taking pictures of people, they will have moved by the time the picture is taken. ---  --- The battery life is very good.  The camera fits nicely in your palm. And, having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great.   ---  --- If you don't shoot in RAW and you don't depend on flash photography, the camera is worth a look.  Otherwise, look at other products at this time	neg
I heard this music on the excellent P B S Documentary: "Liberty - the American Revolution" and I knew I had to have it! It is the finest music I have heard, capturing the heart and soul of the American Revolution. The documentary "Liberty" was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving. So too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment. I love it! I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. It framed the documentary (which I also bought) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting. Superlatives fail me. This music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the American Revolution and then by listening to it apart. This is some of the most wonderful music I have ever heard. It reminds me of the genius of Aaron Copland who wrote the Applachian Spring and Rodeo suites	pos
Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller, a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off, making it dangerous and impossible to use.  Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously).   ---  --- When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance.  PROS for the stroller:  very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles.  There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position. ---  --- CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it.  The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over).  My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat.  And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy. ---  --- Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name "Jeep" it would be built better.  We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke.  My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built?   I would love this stroller if it were just built better	neg
I am very happy with this product. It's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it.  ---  --- I had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over. But my brother fiddled with it and discovered that (unlike the rope in the picture) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it's not right up against the handle. So now I would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it (and the sellers should have known that).      	pos

I really enjoy using this program, much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when I last worked on genealogy.  I love the Ancestry.com feature, it is wonderful to go find your grandparents, great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the US Census.  I have found out a few things that I didn't know, unfortunately my Mother recently passed away, and I have no one to verify some of it with.  I would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now, and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find.  I also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live.  She has traced her family back to the 1500's in Germany...and it appears that they are related to us.  It was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my Great Grandparents headstone.  It was just another branch of the family.  Buy it	pos

... I purchased this item to remove some debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very nicely. ---  --- The microfiber texture feels nice - a little beady, but soft and textured. ---  --- Using it was easy, I just wiped the lens in a circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris was gone. (some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch but wasn't) ---  --- The packaging is a little subpar though. It comes in a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the cloth out. However doing so leaves adhesive residue, which the cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off, making those sections of the cloth appear phyically different - a bit roughed up I'd say. This is poor design as the packaging says to store the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination, so I used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the adhesive residue off. ---  --- I've yet to machine wash it, but so far it works well. It's just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after all	pos
Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn't all that easy to get on and off.  With 8 snap on straps, it's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis.  I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier.  With crib mattresses being vinyl covered, why do we need waterproof sheets anyway.  I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple.  Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products.  By the way, two of the straps broke off in the wash, thank God it was after I realized I didn't need this anyway	neg
This fitness mat is thick and cushy, but I find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it's about a foot too short. My biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover (a major reason I selected this product) shrank to a completely unusable size when I washed it (in cold water, line dried). Now I'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable	neg

I LOVE this pillow. I've had it for about two and a half months now. At first it helped me stay on my side, and was just comfy to snuggle up to. Now that my belly is getting bigger, it gives great support and doesn't let my belly "hang" down. This is great for people who don't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep. I've had no problem with the stuffing. If you are looking for super firm support, try a wedge. This is a pillow, and feels as such. Of course, if you are on a budget, you can always just use a regular pillow, but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable. ---  --- **UPDATE** I'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow! Mine came covered in a zippered cover, so that is what I wash.  Every few nights, I just grab the larger part and shake it HARD until the stuffing falls down, then fluff it and it is as good as new. I also like that, yes, it does take up some room, but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows. All in all, whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice	pos
I knew we needed this thing with 7 people crammed in a van, but I'm short, so I was leary. No problem. It saved our travel experience and wore very well. Easy to work with. Well worth the price, which wasn't bad to begin with	pos
Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM. ---  --- If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe. ---  --- Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.	pos
   This magazine is ill!  I learn about all the new albums coming out, read the review,and if they say they are good, i go out  and buy 'em.  The reviews are also accurate, giving the appropiate number of stars.   I also love the sections on the new artists on the verge.  The cover stories never seem to dis-please me, always givin' me plent of info.  The mini articles are cool, too, from stuff like Warren's Sapp's all-star football team, to all about how Mike Jones was discovered.  One last thing I love about the magazine - they are never thin issues, and you know what that means!!!  	pos

I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough	neg
This camera looks cool. But it's so, so not cool. ---  --- The people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves. This is by far one of the worst products I have ever purchased. EVER. ---  --- By the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place. It "clips" on... but not for long. The camera's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow. It's complelety unreadable. Even with a 150mb card I could only take a few short quality videos. You can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings. And I'm talkin' LOW quality. Worse than any video you've seen online. ---  --- More problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it. The controls and interface are not intuitive. You'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep. Oh, and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are HUUUUGE. They aren't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short. I had the camera in my pocket and when I stood erect, the earphones were violently yanked from my ears. They're obviously intended for Oompa-Loompas. ---  --- I'm sure I could have found more problems with this thing, but it eventually died on me for no reason. ---  --- Don't waste your time with this. You will be sorely disappointed. In fact, if I could give this product a rating of-10 stars I would do so. I'm so extremely disappointed with this camera	neg
I use both this mascara and Lancome Flextencils  when i'm going out, Flextencils first then coat with Hypnose.  My lashes look HUGE and not too clumpy.

My 8-month-old son and I listen to this CD every night, and by the Pachelbel Canon (track 7) he's usually sound asleep.  It is NOT ALL SYNTHESIZER.  The jacket clearly states that the "Music Box Orchestra" includes flute, piano, cello, percussion, english horn, and oboe.  As a musician, I am not offended by the "easy-listening" versions of these classics.  In fact, I enjoy them.  They introduce my son to the timeless melodies WITHOUT OVERSTIMULATING HIM at bedtime.

Sing in me oh muse on this snow day, and let me proclaim the many virtues of this fine tea. The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. It is full without being overbearing, it is seasoned without being overpowering. It's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry.  --- Since conception, I have been in love with tea, but "the Prince" was my first fine tea. I have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity. And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names, it's still my favourite. --- Never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it's flavored with spice. Would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? Ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too.  --- Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties I've had, this one is the clear winner. I've gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes. The stuff is potent enough that you can get, gasp, a reasonably tannin-free second infusion. --- My only reservation is this; once you've entered the universe of fine tea, you can never be satisfied drinking Lipton, Salada, Twinings or Tetley again. In guise of gifts, I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that I may sup of it when I visit. Isn't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is  today preserved by our friends in socialist France? Viva la Revolution! ---  --- rws, 26/1/0	pos

Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material. ---  --- The 5 Lisbon Sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents, in particular their mother. After one of them commits suicide, a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest. An infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it's over, they still don't know how to make sense of it. ---  --- One of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story, certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed. While I'm certainly not faulting the film, we're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are. In fact I couldn't actually name them until someone in the film actually did. It's not that big of a knock but it's one thing I noticed. ---  --- Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board, including Kirsten Dunst and another against-type role for James Woods. Usually very manic, he's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad. There's also the almost unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with Danny DeVito and Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator.  ---  --- The DVD definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of, deleted scenes and a commentary? Than again Lost in Translation seemed kinda sparse. A commentary on this disc from anyone would've been great, even Francis would've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter's first film. I mean this guy did do Godfather, surely he could've given a professional's review of this? ---  --- It's hard to say which film's better but this film is quite a good one regardless and proof that one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible	pos
Though the magazine does have the MLM and "You To Can Get Rich" articles, it has validity. You can do anything if you find the right thing, something your passionate about. I've found the articles may not always fit my exact situation, but I can extract what is meaningful or useful to fit my unique situation or business needs. Isn't that the main goal here? You have to find it, no one is going to hand it to you. Do the research and the work and ask for mentoring. Follow up on the leads and ideas they give you. I truly enjoy this magazine.

We have gone through a few packages of the Table Toppers and we love them!  Our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down....she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive....and she doesn't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating.  We finally found the Shopper Toppers at Toys R Us and I was so excited I bought two packages....and they don't work worth anything!  The adhesive on those is down the sides, not across the top where it should be, to stick on the shopping cart handle....In fact we've decided that the Table Toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart.  Also, with only a Shopper Topper in our bag while out for lunch recently, we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table!  Well done	pos

This product has the potential to be tremendous, but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched. That absolutely ruins the iPod video experience, now that there is LCD glare exposing all the scratches. ---  --- Also, there is a big 'rhigo-skin' logo on the front, which makes the case even that more distracting. ---  --- I'm sure that it isn't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail.  ---  --- What a letdown. ---  --- P.S. if you are buying the 30GB version of this case, it will double the thickness of your setup	neg

This magazine does hold my kids' interest, and I feel it was worth the money for one year.  The articles and photos are meaningful and have helped get my kids interested in a variety of world subjects. ---  --- However, I probably won't renew because I feel the regular National Geographic Magazine is also suitable for kids and better in the long run.  I guess it would be good for parents to screen and limit use of the regular magazine with regards to the very young, but for the most part kids are exposed to relevant current issues at school and in the media anyway, so the issues and photos of National Geographic Magazine are not too adult or inappropriate.	pos

I enjoyed this book having read other non-fiction frontier books. However, I must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools/objects, etc., I could have done without. I would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker, because such descriptions were so detailed.  If you're a technical/hands-on person, then you probably would like knowing how items/tools were built from raw materials in the frontier. But for me, I was more interested in the story, than the instructionals.	pos

I wonder if Jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. One cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a Tom Clancy or John D. Macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. I do not think this is a bad thing, but I, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i.e., Macdonald's "Cape Fear," or use that tired Native American romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. As for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. What we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the Walker parents, Davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, Lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding Medicine Woman. Her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. The men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. I kept seeing Jance speaking for them. So we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for Hollywood to call and possibly star Penelope Cruz as Lani Walker.

The sub-title of this book is very misleading. It does not contain "an action-oriented approach" to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action. The book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page ("One of the things I dislike about myself is...", "One of my emotions I have trouble accepting is...") and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind. For some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper; and there are a lot of them, so be prepared to go through a lot of paper. ---  --- Sure, completing sentences technically counts as an "action". But if you're like me, "action-oriented" implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world, not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts. For someone with social anxiety the last thing I needed was more solitary introspection. ---  --- Branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy; but alas, the practice helped me in no way. Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone	neg
I ordered my unit directly from Jewel Jet. Aside from receiving the unit in a box that was severely damaged as it was drop shipped in its own box,  I have no complaints with it working as advertised. The unit is quite large so you may not want to leave on the counter but the results are SPECTACULAR. It definitely out cleans my Sonic Cleaner.  I have not been able to see a difference between this and the results after I get my jewelry steamed at a large retailer like Fortunoff. I first used it on a G Color VS stones, but it has caused me to start pulling out pieces of lesser quality that I have not worn in ages to give them a revitalizing breath of "fresh steam" and I still label the results as SPECTACULAR.

With my own experimenting, I honestly couldn't tell a difference when using after precleaning pieces in a detergent solution as a competing model - that uses BOTH detergent and distilled water - claims	pos

$23 for the Chinese version and the English subtitles are mad.   The English subtitles available on American cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable.  I don't regret this purchase because I think drama sets SHOULD be $25 tops and the camera is so CLEAR on this dvd compared to what is seen on American cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are.  It made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for ME when I didn't really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable.  ---  --- So what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series?  I don't get the appeal of this show at all.  I thought it was really slow.  My favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise I felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk, breath in, breathe out, and ponder ponder.  I think the phenomenon of the show's popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring.  Just thinking about this show, strips another layer of elasticity from my heart. It's so boring.  ---  --- p.s. This drama got a 20% rating domestically but Sam Soon and Jang Geum scored 50%.

The greatest paragraph in all of Singer is the one at the beginning of his story, Shosha, where he says he knew two dead languages, Hebrew and Aramaic, and was educated to read about the cultic requirements of a temple which had not existed for 1900 years; he knew Yiddish which he considered perhaps not a language at all, and that although his ancestors had lived in Poland for five or six hundred years he knew only a few words of Polish, although he lived in Poland for all of his youth until he came to America. ---  --- Nothing says more about the unhealthy state of the Jews than this.

This toy, like several other Mattel toys I've purchased in the past 5 years are difficult to put together, troublesome to play with, and not durable.

Sure it looks good and the gameplay is ok but the final boss (Jinpachi) is really cheap and lame! Even at the "easy" difficulty, just a couple of hits from this freak and you're dead! The Devil Within mini-game is also stupid, some levels are just impossible and too hard. I wouldn't mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here, not to mention some save points are hidden. Imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles, spending around 2 hours or more to get to the boss level, then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can't save your game, then you're gonna have to redo the entire level again!!! That is one sick stupid game design! The only reason I'm playing this mini-game is just to get the hidden items	neg
As someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living, I was actually appalled by this magazine.  It is ostensibly health conscious, but upon closer examination it ignores important health information.  For example, in one issue, it had a whole article about diabetes and how, thanks to the miracles of science, diabetics can now eat sugary foods.  It proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which.  A truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer, and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet.  I was disappointed with the magazine	neg

You get that stuff on your fingers, and you're forced to either wipe it on something, (gross) or thoroughly lick it off your fingers (gross). I detest snacks with sticky dust crap. This stuff is the worst offender	neg
Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong. ---  --- You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed. ---  --- I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues.  ---  --- So what are my issues? The list is long: ---  --- -- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity. ---  --- -- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer. ---  --- -- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again. ---  --- -- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it. ---  --- -- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one? ---  --- -- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break. ---  --- -- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug. ---  --- -- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility. ---  --- There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar. ---  --- But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better! ---  --- NEW ADDITION TO MY REVIEW: --- Today I discovered that I can no longer paste Excel charts into Word like I used to. When I try, the chart goes in, but any bars/lines disappear. 	neg

Pull ups are NOT very good for potty training, they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom.  Potty training does not include using diapers.  That is what these are is fancy diapers.  If you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them.  The wetness liner is a joke.  These also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants	neg
I have tried 4-5 of theses phones over the last 4 years.  This one works the best of all I have tried.

I owned the VHS version of ''The Wild,Wild World'' but decided to get the DVD this winter. --- WELL..That was a great purchase ! --- I understand people that could see the documentary of Jayne in Europe,as pretty cheaply made,BUT it is still Jayne,and if you love her (as I do),any film she was in (except The Girl can't help it,and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter) was done on the cheap,with ridiculously small budgets. --- 'The Wild,Wild World' gives you the chance to see a candid Jayne in all kinds of very campy situations,and the best scenes are when Jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on... --- It shows a Jayne Mansfield who was indeed a true-original,rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive American Fifties.I can't help comparing her to what Anna Nicole Smith has done with her 'career' as a media sensation,BUT Jayne was doing basically the same FIFTY years ago,which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks. --- When Jayne talks about her film roles,you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself. --- I don't understand how she can be compared to Marilyn Monroe.MM was looking for privacy,more serious roles,spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to,when Jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about.Jayne was not too picky about her roles,and the kind of attention she was getting,and it was her undoing.Sad,but she needed the money to keep up that image,all those children,dogs,and...husbands. --- NOW ,about ''The Labyrinth of Sex'': It is HYSTERICAL !! and a great choice to make the DVD a double-feature,just like the good-old days of the Drive-ins ! --- When you get over the awful dubbing,the documentary is rather well made,naive to today's standards of course,but well-intentionned.Some viewers will just see crass-exploitation,but if you are into Campy,Kitsch movies,and you see Ed Wood Jr. as a genius...well you will love IT !.The movie trailers are very funny as well,and make you wish you could find them. --- So my conclusion is that DVD is an EXCELLENT purchase,a must-have for any serious Jayne Mansfield Fan !!	pos
AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! My hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality, design, and function about products and he loves this carrier.

All of the Isleys early work without the younger Isleys is just as good with them. But these early workouts are more raw-stripped down and pop-oriented. Ron Isley has a way of making country, and rock remakes sound like they were never before recorded. Not too many black artists can do that. To get a taste of the "Real Isleys" before the "Mr. Biggs" persona, get this with "Get into something", and "Givin' it back&quot	pos
 --- You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6. ---  --- There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe. ---  --- But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH. ---  --- It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs. ---  --- To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS. ---  --- In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you. ---  --- Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either. ---  --- I kind of like it	pos

We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son.  Boy, were we wrong.  The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart.  So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again.  He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.   	neg

I am a proffessional car detailer and have used many waxes through my 40 year career. Meguiar's NXT Tech is by far the best wax I have ever used. It leaves a tremendous deep shine and gloss. Keep in mind it is a wax, so it is essential for the best results to use a cleaner polish before applying the NXT. If the surface is clean you could get by with just the wax. I find that it lasts a long time in fact on one of our cars it lasted an entire year and the car sits outside. The key of course is to wash often, once a week is preferable. It leaves minimal residue which can easily be dealt with using a soft tooth brush to get out the excess wax. Every year I strip the wax off our cars and reapply polish and the wax. My 2000 still looks brand new and our other cars as well. I am sold on this product. Give it try and see for yourself. It also smells nice	pos
Better just to throw it away rather than saddle someone with a mistake I made.

I agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice.  It is very strong, and I realized after spraying it twice it only needed once... most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette.  Very much worth the money.

I have a climber!  She could climb out of her crib at age 13 months.  She was way too young for a bed.  We also have the crib tent II and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night--not roaming her room or house while we sleep.  It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room, putting a mattress on the floor, and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe.  Life saver	pos
This looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself.  How they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me.  Fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it	neg

I bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister.  The skates are good overall.  They are easy enough to put on and take off.  The padding inside is nice.  The only drawback I can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll.  I am not sure if I just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates.  I will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting. 	neg
Although I like this album, there's nothing that especially stands out about it. It's typical Bright Eyes, and if you already love the band you won't be disappointed. However, it's not one of their best albums. It's not as good as Lifted, not as addicting as Fevers and Mirrors, and not as raw and endearing as Letting off the Happiness. But yet again, Conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a Dashboard Confessional sort of way	pos
 ---        Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance. ---  ---  As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem.  Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top.  Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass. ---  ---  The scent  is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest.  With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey.  The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too.  It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances. ---  ---         - Gail Cook	pos
Not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies, pretzels, strawberries, etc., but it doesn't even warm up the syrup. So, like someone else said, you may as well fill up a bowl with Hershey's syrup and let the kids dip away.

They thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate	neg
I recently purchased Microsoft office, and so far, I have had the chance to use Microsoft word.  I am familiar with the product as I have had the older version before, with my old computer.   --- I was pleased to find that I had no trouble with using my old files with this new software.  I also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use.  I was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning.   --- I am also glad that it isn't very much different from the old version, so I was able to use the program easily, without much adjustment. 	pos

This past summer I picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before I finally got around to reading them. I was impressed. The quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine I've seen. The image quality, the paper, all top notch. This is a fine arts magazine and doesn't (at least from what I saw) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art. Rather, it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work. There are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine I've read. I intend on subscribing.	pos

This book is poor. It 's not "philosophical" in any sense because it's not logical and it's not supported by the majority of music scholars today.

Reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy, feel-good nonsense	neg
Warner Bros is putting out a series of "Signature Collections".  They are nothing of the sort.  They are studio collections. The word signature implies the best of the best. A signature collection of Hitch's work would not include several of these titles. The rarely seen Foreign Correspondent and I Confess. The failed comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The experimental Dial M for Murder and The Wrong Man.  The middling Stage Fright. Only Strangers on a Train and North By Northwest are signature Hitchcock.  Where are Psycho,  Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, Rebecca, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and, purhaps even, The Lodger?  A signature collection would include all or most of these titles with North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train.  Of course this would oblidge the different studios to cooperate with each other. God forbid. Warner Bros is developing a reputation for shortchanging and lying to its customers.  You're much better off buying your favorite Hitchcock titles individually new or used	neg
I read the directions and followed them to a T. The pain was just too intense (on my gums - they started to bleed!).

The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I love Benefit. That being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. It's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. If you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. It smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. But if you like that..	neg

If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution. ---  ---   Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"	neg

I've owned several watches, including the older G-Shock and the Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch # GW1400DA-9AV (among others). ---  --- First, there are so many G-shock models to choose from. You could have bought the # GW1400DA-9AV (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of July 24, 2006. ---  --- This watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding, kinetic body movement, or batteries), synch with the atomic clock in Colorado (ultimate accuracy), time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters), light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist), stop watch functionalities, day/date functionalities, and countless other time-related functions. In this respect, it's much more functional than a Patek (even the complicated wrist watch models, or the more mundane Rolex, etc.). Of course, it's a lowly Casio, costing a mere $75 (vs. $75,000 for a low end complicated Patek) ---  --- Buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky, probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. One needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch. ---  --- For the fun of wearing it couple times a year, the price, and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches, I'd highly recommend it.	pos
Good grief.  Where do I begin?  We upgraded two computers from 6.0 to ACT 2007.  Prior to the install, we totally reformatted our hardrives and did a clean install of Windows XP.  We performed an XP update, installed MS Office and basically had two smokin' clean machines - more or less brand new.  Then we we installed ACT! 2007 expecting perfection. Our problems with the software have been: ---  --- 1) Miserable, buggy installation - barely worked. ---  --- 2) Inability to convert our old ACT 6.0 e-mail database into the new version of ACT 2007.  ---   --- 3) Slow, slow, sloooowwww performance. ---  --- 4) e-mails will delete themselves for no apparant reason.  This is the worst of all. ---  --- 5) Terrible syncing with the Palm.  Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, overwrites data when it is not supposed to and vice-versa. ---  --- 5) Useless Sage tech support. ---  --- Don't buy this product.  In fact, I would never buy another product from Sage ever again.  My colleague has already ditched ACT! and switched to using the Palm Desktop and Outlook Express.  This was after losing all his e-mails.  If I lose all my e-mails again - I will uninstall and ditch my copy altogether. ---  --- I would love to reclaim the hours of my life lost to this poorly written loser of a program.	neg

I thought I was just going to have to put up with fly-away hair the rest of my life.  This product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it.

I won't spend a long time explaining why I like this movie...it's just mindless fun and that's all it needs to be.

If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can.

I love the City. Its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world. 'New York Magazine' captures some of this , and works to be fashionable and fast, glossy and up-to- date, stylish and hip( If that is still the word.) --- I sort of like some of this, but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic.

And it tells you things about the City no other magazine does.

The EyeTV 2.x software is a bit rough around the edges (compared to Dish DVR and Tivo), but it's very usable and works great.  I bought this so I can watch the Maryland Terrapins at work (CBS MMOD blacks out local games) and it's great to be able to infinitely adjust the video window.  You can record the program and watch it at lunch or when you get a chance.   ---  --- You will need a good antenna and I wish they provided one like Miglia.  But guess what, you can buy the Miglia magnetic antenna and it works better than many larger antennas from Radio Shack or Target.  The Miglia antenna comes apart and can go with you on travel.

I just love this grill.  I previously had a regular Weber kettle charcoal grill, but when my son took it to college I had the perfect excuse to upgrade.   --- The grill is large enough to grill meat and veggies for a family of 4 to 6. The cooking grate has hinged sides. This allows you to easily add more coals every hour or so for extended indirect grilling cooking.  You won't believe how handy the very large and stable table is; it is very durable and cleans up nicely.   --- Store your large bag of charcoal in the rain protected bin, then just pull out the bag to pour charcoal right into the 2 charcoal holders. The charcoal holders keep the coals gathered together to light well and eliminate the need for a "charcoal chimney".  You only need to run the propane burner for 5 minutes to get the coals started, so one canister lasts quite long. (I always set a timer so I don't forget to turn it off.) The charcoal holders are perfect for indirect grilling, just push them to the sides of the kettle when the coals are ready. If direct grilling, you can still use the charcoal holders to heat the coals, then use tongs to dump the coals onto the bottom grate when they are ready. Very convenient.  The bottom wire shelf makes a perfect spot to set the hot charcoal holders after you dump the coals into the grill. --- The stainless steel ash catcher works very well.  (The non-stainless ash catcher on my regular kettle grill didn't work as smoothly and used to catch and jam sometimes.) --- The lid holder is really great.  Just pick up the lid and slide it to the left and it is held in place for you.  No more trying to hang the lid from the little lid hook. --- The thermometer is very handy to monitor temperature for longer cooking items.  If you are BBQing ribs or a roast, keeping the temperature regulated low is important. --- All these little conveniences simply add up to a nice cooking experience. --- I enjoy my gas grill too, but it takes a little more skill to cook over charcoal.  I have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when I serve up a perfectly cooked meal from my beautiful Weber Performer grill. --- Find a spot to show it off - this beauty really looks great in the yard	pos

I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than $30, retail price, even on sale, was $60. The jacket arrived in about a week. Its nice and warm, very good quality. The upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. It fits great and looks good. Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. But all in all I'm very pleased	pos
I absolutely would recommend avoiding this item. It has a vile aftertaste - even if you can stomach artificial sweetener, this product's flavor is so blatantly unnatural.

These speakers are big in size but short on performance.  Except for the price tag, not much else excites one about them.

These speakers lack bass inspite of their size, and sound quality is poor at higher volumes	neg
Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype.  Oooo, no "sulfates"...  Oooo, "essential water"....   Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner... ---  --- I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair.  And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo.  And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong!   I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results.  After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product. ---  --- This product truly deserves 0 stars!!  ---  --- 	neg

While the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud.  ---  --- Buyer beware: the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all!

This is an excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its style. I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however, the case from Palm didn't work for me because I use the phone a lot and I dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime.  So, it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it.  I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it, it hides the Treo's real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag.  This one seems to even enhance the Treo's style	pos

I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use.  I paid only $10, so not much loss.  She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while.  I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub.  Toys helped distract her when she was a little older.  My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight.  To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub.  I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor.  Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink.  Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink.  The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf.  For a little tub bath, I liked it.  It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner	pos
Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style.  he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser!  He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang.  He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.  He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's.  I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice.  As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion	neg
Excellent high-res LCD, but the rest of the phone was a disappointment. Poor overall interface with configuration options in non-intuitive locations. Particularly disappointing was how it handled WiFi. Each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless source. So, I'd go home and try to get it on the wireless, but I'd have to bring up the app, let it spin a while, be told it couldn't connect, then I'd have to tell it to use the local WiFi. It was just clunky. The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone, and a very expensive an bulky one at that. ---  --- I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via WiFi. Much better WiFi management is a must before I'd consider this phone. ---  --- This is a serious example of one device trying to do everything, and doing nothing very well. The device is relatively nice, but I gave it two stars because a $500 price tag means it has to deliver. I bought and quickly returned the phone	neg

The magnet is solid, the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows.  Lenses are clear and functional.  However, they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads, since it can get snug and this is NOT your usual glasses.

Kids will love, and so will adults.  ---  --- Also, once you have the LCD shutter glasses, they will work on any "field sequential" 3d movie you can get your hands on.  ---  --- These movies are thrilling though- especially the non-stop coaster rides in each one.  ---  --- Do you hear what I am saying??

My daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school. It wasn't until years later that I saw it, and I was HORRIFIED!!! This was a movie aimed at children??? What does a children's movie need a sexy bunny for? The lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and "strutting her stuff" on the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after her like a bunch of  sick, depraved perverts. This scene was highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that, the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities. This movie should be kept far, far away from children, and was truly deserving of zero stars	neg
I saw this film at the old Post Office Cinema in East Hampton when it came out in limited release in 1976. Filming was done in 1974 at the mansion on West End Road, now owned by Ben Bradley of the Washington Post. --- The film is great like the rest of the Maysles films. I will pass along this little story. I was working as a desk officer at the old East Hampton Village police station on Newtown Lane about 30 years ago when little Edie called me one winter afternoon.She reported an alien in a ufo flying around the  yard of her house. So I sent a cop up to her mansion and it turned out it was a tree cutter in a cherry picker trimming trees of a neighbor. Another note: The lead detective in the 1972 raid of the Beale's house, is now the mayor of that charming village	pos
I forced myself to finish this book before I reviewed it, and being through with it now, I feel as though I've learned very little.  I had so many problems with this book, or rather the way of writing, mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author, that this was a difficult read.  In his defense, he is, in MOST things, very thorough.  My main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what Leonardo was (or as he sometimes put it "must have been") thinking or feeling.  While I give Mr. Bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject, in my opinion, that still gives him no right to use what I understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views.  Since he himself stresses that Leonardo's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings, he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations.  In the instances that there is a controversy over some area of Leonardo's life, the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter, but only puts forward his OWN opinion, and his reasons why he believes what he does, without explaining the opposite side of the matter.  In this manner, he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter.  Sentences beginning with "I think" or "In my view" are not uncommon.  He also makes certain assumptions about the reader, referring often to other artists' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them.  Also, he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of Leonardo's, often drawing attention to coloring or texture, without ever showing it, though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout.  The author is an undoubtedly intelligent, well-learned man, very erudite where Leonardo da Vinci is concerned, but entirely overbearing in his writing.  Overall, unless you are well versed in the Renaissance artists and don't mind being pulled out of a book by the author's VIEWS, then I would HIGHLY suggest staying away from this one	neg
I bought this house for my daughter who will be 3 in 2 month's.  I did a lot of research and was torn between the twin town house and this one the Loving Family Sweet Sound's house. At first I almost went with the My first doll house by Fisher Price but was told by a friend she would proberly grow out of that fast and she was right.  This house the Sweet Sound's is a perfect size for her and I know she will get quite a few year's out of it.  Yes the Furniture is impossible to find.  After reading the review's I didn't look for it much knowing I would never find it.  I ended up buying her the Twin town's bathroom and a few pieces from the My first doll house by Fisher Price.  The pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her and not so many tiny pieces.  They work great with the doll's that come with it too.  I did also purchase one doll set from twin town house.  The house does make some sound's with just the pieces that come with it, they are cute and my daughter doesn't know any better that it would make more if we could of found the correct sweet sounds furniture.  She's Happy with the way it is. I decided against the Twin Town because I agreed with some reviewers after looking at it that the room's were too tiny.  Yes you get more room's but my daughter I know would get so frusterated with alway's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room's.  This house has big room's.  It fold's up easy in half but not so good when it is filled with furniture.  We leave it open anyway's so that is not a big deal.  It was easy put together but the sticker's took about and hour to put on.  Also a note make sure and put the battery in BEFORE you fill it with furniture, I put the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture everywhere.   ---   Also I didn't see any one mention the front door.  I am not really sure why but it doesn't open from the outside, only from the inside.  You can open it from the outside but you have to pull it very hard and really aren't supose to open it that way.  Why not be able to open it both way's???  I guess their thinking is so if you are moving it so the door doesn't swing open but they could of put a little latch on it so you could of closed it shut when you wanted.    ---   Also I am not sure what room is supose to be the bathroom.  I think it is either the bedroom or above that which I thought was the kid's playroom.  I ended up putting the bathroom in the right side of the bathroom. --- All in all I think is is a great doll house and I would recommend it	pos

I purchased a Nintendo DS (in the pink color) a couple of weeks ago. Because I travel several times a year, I needed something that could entertain me during long plane trips. ---  --- About a year ago, I purchased a Gameboy Advance but I didn't like the graphics. The screen was too small and it was difficult to see what was going on. Needless to say, I sold it a few weeks after. ---  --- I was still interested in buying a portable game system however and didn't know whether to purchase a DS or a PSP. The PSP cost quite a bit more but it also allows you to play movies on it. I ended up going with the DS because the store where I bought it only had demos for the DS, not the PSP.  ---  --- The Nintendo DS has good graphics (at least far better than the GBA). One thing you must look at when deciding which portable game system is best for you is the selection of games. The majority of Nintendo DS games are for kids. However, there are several games that adults can play that will "tickle your brain". I tend to go for the puzzle games but a few of the kid games are fun as well.  ---  --- What I also like about the DS is that you don't have to press down too hard on the screen using the stylus. You can purchase screen protectors for your DS but unless you're pressing down much harder than you should, you won't need these. Also, you can store the stylus on the bottom of your system. The box contains extra stylii in case you lose one but the handy storage compartment should prevent this from happening. ---  --- You don't have to charge the system too often. Usually one charge lasts several hours. However, whenever I'm playing at home, I always plug in the adapter. ---  --- Also, there's a headphone jack in case you don't want to annoy other people with the audio from the game you're playing. Headphones don't come with the system so you have to buy them seperately (I bought the DS Starter pack which comes with special DS headphones). ---  --- As far as portable game systems go, I suggest purchasing the DS. They're perfect for any age (preschool age to adult) and the price isn't *too* up there.	pos

Yes, the kit is easy to use, but if you don't bleed freely, get a few extra lancets before you start. Most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free.

Do not be fooled by this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry!  I have been a long time fan of the original Pop-Tart and the Go-Tart just seemed like the natural progression of things, so I went along with the newest technology in mass produced baked goods.  The Go-Tart offers you a Pop-Tart on the go, because everyone knows this is the 21st century and we are on the move.  I'm venturing to guess that Go-gurt was a success so why not make a Go-Tart?  Well, there are a number of reasons.  Actually just one.  You can already eat a Pop Tart on the go. --- It's too bad the Go-Tart ruined everything I loved about the Pop-Tart.  The greatest hope I had for this flop of a product was that the frosting (or what you'd like to call that sugary stuff on the top) would reach the corners of the tart, unlike the original Pop-Tart.  Though the sugar covers the corners, there is barely any frosting at all on this tart!  It is but a thin line of the sugary goodness we would all expect from a normal Pop-Tart.  The filling has a gooey consistency, and worst of all, the breading part crumbled in my hand.  I had to eat my Go-Tart in pieces.  This is clearly not on the go.  This is worse than a Pop-tart, and is probably more fattening than one.  Save your money, boycott the Go-Tart	neg

like many new parents, I had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib... WELL... upon his arrival, my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and I for the first 6 weeks, plus he helped my husband and I sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made (for a new parent all the sounds are scary).  we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine, and went back to sleep.  Yes, it was a bit tight in a queen size bed, but most importantly, he was safe and we did not have to get up.  We used in bed until 6 weeks old, and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks.  overall, well worth it, plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2-3 months	pos

The almonds are slightly seasoned with a 'barbecue' kind of flavoring, which is subtle but nice. The cashews, on the other hand, are hard to believe. The taste conjures up images for me of them being stored in semi-pervious containers in the paint-and-finishing room of my high school industrial arts class. They are REALLY awful, and any lover of cashews will be appalled	neg

I bought one of the custom tile #7's (loaded with options) from California and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self-destruct. I tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years, until they skipped to Mexico. Tiles just didn't fall off, they spalted. The fire box broke, etc. When it got too bad to use and look at, we had to throw it away . . . a $1500 mistake. ---  --- If there was a really good ceramic cooker out there, I would try it again.

This DVD version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable.  Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in particular!  ;) ---  --- I don't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format.  It didn't bother me at all.  Disappointment I could understand, but this kind of vitriol?  It's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages, and I found it a refreshing change from the dumbed-down "kid's" movies they tend to make these days.  Adults will enjoy the suspenseful story, retro style, and feline antics just as much as kids will.  I'd skip the remake and get the original	pos

So, if it's such an excellent game, why 4 stars on "fun" rating? ---  --- Well, it's a very very fun game, but some parts can get annoying and aggravating. And it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades, which is kinda cheap, if you ask me. They physically limit you, instead of strategicly doing so. ---  --- But everything else is great about it. Graphics are great, not excellent, but great. Sound is great too. Gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed. Kinda on the easy side in normal level, though. But, I guess nothing is perfect. ---  --- Go ahead and get this one.

Quickbooks "sunsetted" my previous version, forcing me to buy this horriblle, buggy software.

Well, I ordered this online as we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally. It's lasted exactly two weeks. The problem is the extremely weak design: the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy-too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups, as this has. There are somewhat strange instructions with this model, directing the user to "rub" the suction cups for several minutes in order to (supposedly) build up a proper "suction"-then the glass slides into a groove; well, the thing worked at first-until I had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it. I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess. What a crummy product! And overpriced-although I wouldn't buy it again for two cents. Beware	neg
I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, "Interiors" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.   ---  --- Woody Allen's greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves.  His characters have faults that we share.  Whatever passions that we have fallen prey to, we see them in a new light through Allen's masterful script and direction.  The problem with "Interiors" is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in "Interiors" have.  Many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us.  Woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by Ingar Bergman.  Allen's own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it.   ---  --- Taken in its' own right, "Interiors" is an above-average movie.  The acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner.  The movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess.  These people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other Woody Allen cast (with the bumbling exception of the cast of "What's New Pussycat?").   ---  --- Woody Allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way.  Fortunately, he learned from his experience. 	pos
I'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout I can get by using these high-resistance water gloves.

The "microscope" never worked at all. It is cheap plastic and very badly made.

Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis?  "Spankmaster" represents a regression of creative energy.

With the exception of a couple songs ("jewelry shine" and "Blackula"), this album stinks	neg
OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon	neg
My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004. ---  --- It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and  domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played. ---  --- I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever! ---  --- As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence	neg
This is not a shoot-em-up Western. If that is what you are after, stop reading right here. What this is, is a real heartfelt tribute to the cowboy. The genuine article cowboy. In particular, it charts a group of cowboys through the decline of the golden age of the cowboy, near the end of the 19th Century. Almost the whole of the first half of the movie, there is no plot to speak of, just character exposition building up the picture of the life and character that these men had. Nothing is rushed, and yet it is never dull, thanks to an intelligent script. There are humorous moments and great lines, but plenty of pathos and melancholy too, as the characters all deal with the end of an era in their own ways. We see the cowboy-turned-outlaw, the cowboy-turned-storekeeper, the cowboy-turned-floor sweeper... but most of all we see the cowboy turned into legend. As the plot kicks in, there is nothing contrived about it, but it all feeds into the central idea of examining what men do when their purpose is taken away from them.  --- The movie benefits from some great performances from some classic character actors such as William Devane and Barry Corbin, as well as a brilliant star turn from Tom Selleck who has never been better. It also benefits from the stunning scenery - ironically not in Wyoming as the movie suggests, but shot in Canada. The sweeping vistas, free of any trace of civilization, set against a backdrop of the Rockies, are stunning and superbly photographed.  --- What pulls this above it's TV-movie-of-the-week origins is the sincerity poured into it by all concerned, and not least by the prolific director Simon Wincer (Lonesome Dove, Quigley Down Under... and Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles! ) and executive producer Tom Selleck. This fills the movie with those little, almost subliminal moments which make it feel real.  --- The result is no classic big screen film, but a perfectly judged and understated homage to a bygone era. It leaves us with the notion, that though the golden age is over, there will always be real cowboys. 	pos
I purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it. The drive has a controller board error.  I contacted Western Digital for a replacement, but they tell me that it is out of warranty.

If it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from Western Digital. With other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties, I will never buy Western Digital again	neg

Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing.  It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors.  (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)      ---  --- Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had:  360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.     ---  --- Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie.  	neg
The Molesking plain reporter is an excellent notebook in many ways, without doubt one of the best on the market.  ---  --- When you first open it and see the cover page with its space for a reward for its return, you know that any Moleskine notebook is a throwback to a more literate time when words and ideas were more important to the people who made them. Holding one allows you to imagine great people doing great things and that owning one brings you closer to them--not just writers, but musicians, scientists and mathematicians or anyone else who needed to have an idea and hold on to it. ---  --- In its design, the Moleskine Reporter is a classic with convenience features that make it surprisingly modern. Its built-in rubberized cloth band keeps it from falling open when dropped; it's back pocket allows you to keep miscellaneous papers and items like receipts, stamps and photographs without making you resort to your wallet. Its featureless blank pages allow you to establish your own formatting as you work (making it perfectly suitable for combinations of notes and sketches in landscape and portrait formats)--the perfect feature when your forms of creativity require notes and drawings for visualization. Better still, its semi-hard covers give you a writing surface anywhere you have an idea, from your hand when standing on a streetcorner to your thigh during a train or plane-ride. The Moleskine Plain Reporter is something special, a throwback to a more literate age that is perfectly sized to fit in the back pocket of a pair of Levis	pos
I have owned a Brinkman smoker for 14 years...not this one, but the more simple model that costs about $85.00.    I have smoked several turkeys, many chickens, salmon, pork roasts....ALL with great success.  TWO things I can think of might help with your low temperature problem: ---  --- 1.  Did you use an extension cord with it?  I once had the same problem you had when I used a long extension cord. Troubleshooting, I searched the manual that came with it and found that it says not to use long extension cords (you'll have to search your manual for the maximum optimum length).  PLEASE don't give up on your smoker!  I get much more  tender, juicy results than I do with my flambeed grilled meats!! ha ha!   The smoker is easy to use, no fuss and not too bad of a mess to clean if you line your water pan with heavy duty foil! I use Easy-Off oven cleaner on my two racks and water pan and be sure to rinse them very well.  I can leave for four hours and my food will be ready when I return (just be sure your water pan always has liquid in it)  When we have company, they LOVE the smoked flavor.  Hope this helps.  Once I eliminated the long extension cord, all was well.   --- 2.  Were you peeking at your turkey or basting it?  My lid also has a small gap through which the smoke escapes, but it doesn't affect it.  You cannot constantly open the lid to peek or baste as this allows the heat to escape and it will take a while for the smoker to reach the proper temperature again.  NO NEED to baste with a smoker! The meat is always juicy. ---  --- I found your review because after 14 years, I'm seeing rust on my smoker, which was one of the best of our wedding gifts.  I never owned a cover for it but always stored it in the garage when not in use.  This last year, however, it spent much time neglected outside (I have four children now) and I wanted to research smokers to find the replacement for our trusty old one!  ---  --- I would highly recommend a Brinkman electric smoker to anyone who is considering purchasing one (sorry, I've never tried another brand).  It's so much easier than grilling because you never need to watch over your food to prevent charring.  I guess you could say a smoker is to a grill as a crockpot is to an oven, except that unlike crockpot food, the meat will appear beautifully golden-browned with NO blackness. 	pos

The price on this is a bit steep, especially since the bonus materials are limited (though enjoyable). Nonetheless, I didn't regret spending the money. The Maysles brothers were such amazing and groundbreaking documentarians that anything of theirs that you can get your hands on is worth it. This film follows four very ordinary bible salesmen in the late 1960's as they ply their trade in the cold and snow of New England and then in the sunshine of Florida. The Maysles' focus in particular on one gentleman who clearly is not cut out for this work and is slowly but surely headed for the scrap pile. Despite the relative mundanity of the events, you find yourself transfixed as these men endure the high-powered mindwashing of their superiors and struggle to survive in a dying industry. Few films have ever so poignantly made the point that, though God may be good box office, no one really seems to give a damn about who buys or sells the tickets to the show	pos
I bought TendSkin to help with the irritation and razor bumps I get on my neck from shaving. The product claims to, "reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and redness from shaving." But despite it's lofty promises and high price, it does none of this. In fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse, I have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol. The directions tell you to apply it after shaving, but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving, it only made my problem worse. I wish I could have rated this product zero stars, because it is absolutely worthless	neg

I first got one of these as a gift back in the late '80s when I bought my first new car. It worked exactly as advertised and in the intervening years, I have replaced it only two or three times...  ---  --- It does actually work better once it gets dirtier - I can absolutely attest to this as I got a new one about a year ago, and the older one worked better at first... After a couple weeks (I dust the car about about four times a day), it started to work as well as the older one. I took the old one and tried washing it by hand with cold ater and Woolite, as recommended on the makers website, and it definitely was cleaner and still worked just as well.  ---  --- If you love your car even half as much as I do, this product is worth EVERY cent	pos
I write with Noodler's Black (the brand's "standard" black ink) almost every day because I can't always choose the paper to write on. Noodler's Black can be used for two-sided writing on bad paper, even newsprint, which is rare among all the fountain pen inks in the world. ---  --- I also write with Noodler's Black because it's waterproof, forgery-proof, good-looking, and pleasantly smooth during writing. I confidently write checks with Noodler's Black, and it is safe for signing valuable or important documents too (when black is an acceptable color; ask your lawyer). ---  --- Please keep in mind that the Noodler's company carefully says which of the brand's colors are waterproof and which are not. In my experience Noodler's Black is by far the best Noodler's color for writing on both sides of bad paper. ---  --- One behavior you might notice, if your pen's nib is an exposed metal surface (not covered with colored enamel), is that Noodler's (standard) Black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces. This "nib creep" is harmless behavior because the ink doesn't run down onto the grip area. Wiping the ink off the nib is only temporary; more ink will soon spread to replace what you wiped off. Again, this is harmless behavior and a very small price to pay for the security of your marks, signatures and important handwritten texts	pos

I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked. ---  --- And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like. ---  --- If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all. ---  --- I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah	neg
The book is well-written.  Most parts of it I can agree with.  But there is a crucial mistake in Parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation.   I can say clearly that oneness does not play separation.  Duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution.  Saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion.  Also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the "mercy" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic.  Without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.  There are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap.  In my life, it was understanding, especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness.  The one who is doing the understanding is still oneness.  There is no duality in doing and not doing.  At right this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop.  Of courses, you make choices in daily life.  If you really understand what is meant by "nond-duality", you will not make such statements such as "there is no choice".  	neg
I just received this today.  Somehow I completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain.  Had I noticed that, I probably would not have ordered this piece - and I would have missed out.  It is very nice.  It has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but substantial.  The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.	pos

I did a lot of searching and review reading on the internet before finally deciding what to buy. I am convinced Quick Draw II is THE best value available of any make by any conpany. The features on the QDII are generally found only on much higher priced detectors. This thing really works as advertised. I have already found several coins and other things right in my own yard. It will reliably indicate what coin is being detected although it many times confuses dimes and pennies on the LCD readout. It is very sensitive and detects most coin size items very reliably to about 6 or 8 inches. The auto notch discrimination works well and filters out most trash items. I have used metal detectors that ended up being aggravating and frustrating. This one is a pleasure to use and is quickly becoming a relaxing and profitable pastime for me. If you want a serious metal detector without spending a whole lot of money give it a try... you won't be disappointed..	pos

Tunisian Anouar Brahem's "Le Voyage de Sahar" finds him in the same company- pianist Francis Courturier and accordionist Jean-Louis Martinier- as 2002's highly acclaimed "Le pas du chat noir." --- Having toured in support of that CD, the trio developed into a true group, something that Brahem accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble. --- With "Voyage" Brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not as overtly "jazzy" as some of his earlier outings. --- Nonetheless, he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid, richly evocative compositions that distill Arabic music and European jazz sensibilities with a warm, sonorous chamber music vibe. --- Among the ports of call on this "Voyage" are "Zarabanda," whose elegant lope recalls the French Riviera. --- Elsewhere the title track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue, while "Cordoba" and "Ete Andalous" are meditative pieces with a decidedly cinematic scope.  The gentle bounce of "Nuba" and introspection of "Les Jardins de Ziryab" both include uncredited but effective passages of voice. --- Rarely do you hear music this gorgeous	pos

I am a big Lush fan - but Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo is my favorite product! ---  --- It does smell VERY strongly of beer when you use it, so if you have an aversion to that smell, you won't like this.  At first I didn't like the smell, but now I think it's sort of a nice "wake up."  I don't smell it on my hair when it's dry as other reviewers have noticed - although I use (non-Lush) conditioner afterwards, so maybe that tends to wash the smell away? ---  --- This shampoo makes my hair SO shiny.  I have long blonde hair, and it really makes it glow like nothing else.  I don't know how it does it...but people will literally come up to me and comment on how nice and shiny my hair looks on the days I use this product!   ---  --- Oh, and this shampoo is very concentrated - a little goes a long way.

       I'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be disappointed.	pos

My other one makes a low static sound all the time, it is not bother some but I can still hear it.  I would highly recommend this model.

My impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the "philosophy" of the main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is nothing we haven't seen done better other places. ---  --- All in all, I found it pretty vapid, painfully slow, and incredibly frustrating, because there is a good movie in here SOMEWHERE, if only the script had gone to someone else to make. ---  --- On a side note, Toby Maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser, which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went	neg

La Bamba (1987.) The soundtrack to the Ritchie Valens biopic of the same name. ---  --- INTRODUCTION: --- In 1987, the film La Bamba, based on the life and times of fifties pop-rock star Ritchie Valens, was released. The film cast Lou Diamond Phillips as the classic musician, and told his story, from his rise to fame, right down to his young and tragic death. For the film, Los Lobos, a fairly popular act of the day, was asked to rerecord classic Valens material for the movie. Some other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for the film. So, how is the soundtrack? Read on, and find out! ---  --- OVERVIEW: --- The La Bamba soundtrack was released in 1987, around the same time as the film of the same name. Contributors to the soundtrack include Los Lobos, Howard Huntsberry, Marshall Crenshaw, Brian Setzer, and Bo Diddley. The A-Side of the soundtrack sonsists of the Los Lobos covers of the Ritchie Valens songs La Bamba, Come On Lets Go, Ooh My Head, We Belong Together, Framed, and Donna. The B-Side consists of the other artists' covers, which include Howard Huntsberry's cover of Jackie Wilson's Lonely Teardrops, Marshall Crenshaw's cover of Buddy Holly's Crying Waiting Hoping, Brian Setzer's cover of Eddie Cochran's Summertime Blues, Bo Diddley's remake of his own classic tune Who Do You Love, and the two songs Los Lobos recorded for the film which were not remakes, Charlena and Goodnight My Love. ---  --- REVIEW: --- Awesome movie, awesome soundtrack. I'm a huge fan of the music of Ritchie Valens, and for the most part, La Bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of the Valens saga. Aside from some omitted material (which I'll get to later), the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it represents. Read on for my reviews of the tracks. ---  --- -SIDE A- ---  --- -La Bamba by Los Lobos: Los Lobos covers the track that took Ritchie Valens to the top of the musical world. Being a folk song, no one ever thought a rock and roll version would do well - Valens proved the non-believers wrong! Los Lobos does a great cover of it, too. The band actually did two versions of the song for the movie - a rendition of the slower, folksier version by the bar band that convinced Valens to cover the song himself, as well as the classic version Valens did. This is the classic Valens version. I wish they had included both versions of the soundtrack, though (although an instrumental sequence near the end of this version DOES reprise elements of the folk-type version. Still, I wanted BOTH versions as complete, separate tracks!) ---  --- -Come On Lets Go by Los Lobos: This classic rockabilly-style cut was another huge hit for Ritchie Valens. Los Lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut, staying true to the Valens original while at the same time adding their own spin onto things. All in all, another great song. ---  --- -Ooh My Head by Los Lobos: Not much to say about this one. Once again, Los Lobos manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic Valens tunes people know and love him for. Every song on this soundtrack is excellent, and this one is no exception. ---  --- -We Belong Together by Los Lobos: Ah, the classic Valens love song. Although its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad Donna, this one was still a fairly notable hit for Valens. The Los Lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one - but I shouldn't have to tell you that, now should I? ---  --- -Framed by Los Lobos: Of all of the Ritchie Valens song that Los Lobos revisited in La Bamba, this one is the least well known. That's a shame, because it's a great song! The song takes a classic blues styling, and puts a rockabilly spin on it. Once again, Los Lobos does a marvelous cover version of the song. ---  --- -Donna by Los Lobos: This song was so big a hit for Ritchie Valens initially, that his only song even on the same plane of popularity is La Bamba. The classic ode Valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff that has withstood the test of time. And I know you're probably getting tired of me saying this for every song, but Los Lobos really does a good job on here. ---  --- -SIDE B- ---  --- -Lonely Teardrops by Howard Huntsberry: In La Bamba, Howard Huntsberry portrayed the classic soul singer Jackie Wilson. And here, Huntsberry reprises Wilson's signature tune. This is classic soul at its very best. Prior to seeing La Bamba, I had never even heard of Huntsberry. But the real shocker is that I ended up liking this version of the song more than the original! Definitely a solid, underrated cut. ---  --- -Crying Waiting Hoping by Marshall Crenshaw: Marshall Crenshaw, a fairly popular eighties pop signer, managed to land the role of Buddy Holly in La Bamba. Holly, of course, was killed in the same plane crash that claimed the life of Ritchie Valens. Buddy Holly is a tough guy to cover, but Marshall Crenshaw does a damn good job of it. I personally prefer this version over Holly's original (and that's saying a lot since I LOVE Buddy Holly!) If you're interested in hearing Crenshaw cover another Holly tune, check out the remastered version of his 1982 self-titled debut - he covers Rave On on there as a bonus track. ---  --- -Summertime Blues by Brian Setzer: Long before Brian Setzer gained any real fame, he played Eddie Cochran in La Bamba, covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend. Here's another one of those covers that is so good, I like it more than the original. Definitely worthwhile listening - but then again, isn't every song on here? ---  --- -Who Do You Love by Bo Diddley: Bo Diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago, and was asked to rerecord it for La Bamba. He did, and the end results are solid. Diddley is a legend of the blues, and this recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that way. It just a shame that the version of this song most people remember is the George Thorogood one, because Diddley's version is the song the way it was meant to be heard.  ---  --- -Charlena by Los Lobos: In addition to the Ritchie Valens covers, Los Lobos recorded two new songs for the La Bamba soundtrack. This is the first of the two. Essentially, this here is a neo-rockabilly track of sorts, and a damn good one too. Long after the fifties music scene died out, Los Lobos still managed to record a song that suited the style perfectly. ---  --- -Goodnight My Love by Los Lobos: Here's the second of the newly-recorded Los Lobos songs done for the soundtrack. What we have here is one of those classic fifties-style rock ballads that were so popular back then. If you're into that sort of thing, you're going to love this song - I know I do! ---  --- -OTHER COMMENTS- --- Omissions are the biggest problem with this soundtrack, by far. As I previously stated, only one version of La Bamba is on here - not both versions from the film. Another omission is Sleepwalk, the classic Santo And Johnny instrumental that shows up frequently in the film. Its omission is likely due to the fact that it wasn't recorded just for the film, but still, I miss it. And then there's the issue of Rip It Up, the classic Ritchie Valens rockabilly tune he first plays with his band in their garage, early on in the film. This was one of my favorite songs in the film, and I was devastated not to see it on here. And where's the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace? I rated this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions. If these songs had been on here, it would be five stars all the way. ---  --- OVERALL: --- Overall, despite my issues with the omitted songs, I am very satisfied with the La Bamba soundtrack. Much like the movie, it's an excellent experience all the way through. If you liked the movie, or you're just into this sort of music, the soundtrack is well worth owning. Highly recommended! ---  --- EDITION NOTES: --- This soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on compact disc, implying it may be very gradually going out of print. Take my advice - if you want it, just buy it online. It's the fastest, easiest way to get it.	pos

Seinfeld-Season 6 would see the sitcom finally hit #1 in the Nielsen ratings. This was also the season where the storylines became more complicated as Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer would all be involved in one caper or another in the same episode. George's parents, Frank and Estelle Costanza, as well as Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld, and Newman are featured more prominently and we also see the debut of several strong role players such as Mr. Pitt, David Puddy, and Kenny Bania. Amazingly, the storylines stayed strong throughout the season as several episodes would become classics. And while Jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four main actors, his work improved a lot during this season.  ---  --- Disc 1 starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes "The Big Salad" and "The Pledge Drive" as well as the hysterical classic, "The Couch." "The Chinese Woman" and "The Gymnast" are also very good episodes, both showing the continuing neuroses of the Costanzas. The sitcom always seems to have great episodes on Disc 2 and this is no exception with "The Soup", "The Switch", where we finally learn Kramer's first name, and "The Race" all being classic episodes. Disc 3 is also top notch, featuring the excellent "The Scofflaw", "The Kiss Hello", and "The Doorman", also known as "The Bro", as well as the two-part "Highlights of 100" episode. Disc 4 starts out with the classic episode "The Jimmy", which earned Michael Richards an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor, the excellent "The Fusili Jerry", and the strong season finale, "The Understudy", which mirrors the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan fiasco, only with Bette Midler, of all people, playing the victim. As usual, the extras are just as strong as the episodes. The Running With the Egg featurette that shows how an episode of Seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus far in the Seinfeld series. The bloopers are also very funny from this season, especially the ones from "The Fusili Jerry" episode. The deleted scenes, inside looks, exclusive stand-up material, and the Notes About Nothing are also top notch. Although not quite on the level of Season 4, which was their best season, Season 6 was another great season for Seinfeld as the writing was still top notch and the ensemble cast was running on all cylinders. Highly recommended.  	pos

They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny	neg
I read a review of this in L.A. Weekly which said that it was "a lot  of fun" and entertaining in a sort of ironic way, despite the fact  that it became more slapstick at the end.  I read it, and agreed for the  most part, except I felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier  than I had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than I  would have thought from the initial satirical tone.  The ending was a  little over the top, but it was an example of the kind of senseless  fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives.  All  in all, I thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel	pos
I don't know what this customer is talking about when he said it smells horrible... IT SMELLS LIKE A NEW CAR.  Not flowers, or fresh air, NEW CAR.  The stuff has worked great for me.

This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.  Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair.  The hair that is removed doesn't stay gone long.

Wow, how nice to watch Sam Cooke's story from beginning to end. Interviews with the family adds a wealth of inside information. I never knew Sam's father was a Chicago minister and of course Sam was the younger one who surprised the family when he first sang! Unfortunate for music that his life was taken so early. After watching this DVD, I bought Sam Cooke music and surpised that some songs are songs I had no idea Sam wrote	pos

I have been a NIN fan since Pretty Hate Machine. I think Trent Reznor is a brilliant musician. All of his previous albums have been absolute genius....until this? I pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece. What a disappointment!! I still can't get over how terrible this album is! The only song that is worth mentioning is "You Know What You Are." That's the Trent I know! I purposely skipped the tour just so I didn't have to hear the new stuff! I hope this isn't it for him, but I will be cautious when the next album comes out	neg

I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time.  Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge.

We have used more expensive "professional" grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the Integrity compares for a home version.

 Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game.

After twice sending the unit back to the factory, the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on.  I tried all the suggestions made by the factory.  The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong.  I found totally frozen fan bearings.  I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings.  To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump.  The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable.  When it worked, it worked well.  I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito	neg
First things first, you will not be treated to that classic 'cooking' smell.    In fact, your appetite is better off not catching a whiff of that magnesium-salt concoction that heats your meal.  Think happy thoughts, and be oblivious. ---  --- Why?  Because the meal itself is actually pretty good (and has an airtight separation with the 'oven').  The package also includes plastic spork, knife, and napkin.  Basically, the ingredients are on-par with what you would typically find in canned stew (and similarly need not be refrigerated).   ---  --- However, the meal loses one star because the serving size is fairly small.  210 calories isn't a whole lot to go on, particularly if you must engage in strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions.  ---  --- Pros: lightweight, keeps well, cooks itself, easy disposal, tastes good. ---  --- Cons: cost and storage space per calorie is somewhat high. ---  --- If you were creative, you might be able to figure a way to cook something else using the box oven	pos

I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25	neg
For those that have have played similar games like Sim City before, this one was great! I have played Sim City 2000, but that was years ago. I had found that game addicting. Now, years later, when I ordered Sim City 4: Deluxe Edition, I was blown away! This game is much better than 2000 could hope to be. They have resolved many of the issues that I had with the older game and then some. I have found this game to be addicting to, and have started different cities at the same time. I am working on getting the "perfect city" for me to be happy with. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of any of the Sim games. I could even say at times it was funny even to read the tongue-in-cheek sayings that come up just as you are starting up the game for the day like "Bureaucratizing Bureaucracies". It was not so much hilarious but, it can help you get in the "fun mode" to play the game. The advisors can get slightly annoying after awhile, especially when you have a different idea about what you want to see in your city than they do, but it is still overall a very entertaining game. My next purchase will most likely be Sims 2, for more of the Sims experience	pos

Forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today's "music" too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them, "Hollaback Girl" is the absolute DUMBEST "song" I've ever had the displeasure to hear. ---  --- There are two main parts to this travesty: 1. Where she says "That's my sh**" no less than a million times, and 2. She demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us. ---  --- If this is supposed to be rap, Stefani failed miserably.  If it's supposed to be dance, again, she failed miserably.  To be honest, I don't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music.   ---  --- The fact that it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't have any requirements for their ears.  - Donna Di Giacom	neg

I didn't think it could be any better than the 3rd version when they added the duets. This version takes the game to a whole new level. There is a wide variety of songs, so many different types of people can play. There are several songs that begin locked, but it didn't take too long to get them unlocked. The mini games are terrible and there was no need for them on the disk.  ---  --- I found that it is near impossible to both sing and dance at the same time. If you don't know all the words to a song, it is impossible to read the singing and dance lines at the same time. Besides, it's extremely difficult to speak, much less sing while exerting yourself on the dance pad. I recommend having one person sing and another dance. This changes it up and gives you some great songs to dance to. I like the DDR games, but never have been crazy about the songs, so I really like the great songs.  ---  --- Here is a complete list of the songs on the game as well as the artist of the version of the song:  ---  --- Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing - Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell  --- Ain't Too Proud to Beg - The Temptations  --- Always - Atlantic Starr  --- American Woman - Lenny Kravitz  --- Brick House - The Commodores  --- Call Me - Blondie  --- Crazy - Aerosmith  --- Crazy in Love - Beyonce  --- Do You Really Want To Hurt Me - Culture Club  --- Drive - Incubis  --- Dust in the Wind - Kansas  --- Endless Love - Lionel Richie & Diana Ross  --- Every Little Thing She Does is Magic - The Police  --- Everybody Wants to Rule the World - Tears for Fears  --- Everywhere - Michelle Branch & Santana  --- Fame - Irene Cara (from the soundtrack)  --- Fly - Hilary Duff  --- For You I Will - Monica  --- Greatest Love of All - Whitney Houston  --- Headstrong - Trapt  --- Here I Go Again - Whitesnake  --- I Don't Want to be - Gavin DeGraw  --- (I've Had) The Time of My Life - Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes (Dirty Dancing soundtrack)  --- I Left My Heart in San Francisco - Tony Bennett  --- I Love Rock and Roll - Joan Jett  --- I Will Always Love You - Whitney Houston  --- If You Could Only See - Tonic  --- I'll Be - Edwin McCain  --- Material Girl - Madonna  --- Me and Bobby McGee - Janis Joplin  --- Pain - Jimmy Eat World  --- Pieces of Me - Ashley Simpson  --- Play That Funky Music - Wild Cherry  --- Start Me Up - The Rolling Stones  --- Superstition - Stevie Wonder  --- Sweet Caroline - Neil Diamond  --- Takin' Care of Business - Bachman-Turner Overdrive  --- Take On Me - A-Ha  --- That's Amore - Dean Martin  --- The Game of Love - Michelle Branch  --- Time After Time - Cyndi Lauper  --- Truth Is - Fantasia Barrino  --- Turn the Beat Around - Gloria Estefan  --- Unforgettable - Nat King Cole  --- Uptown Girl - Billy Joel  --- Waiting for a Girl Like You - Foreigner  --- What I Like About You - Romantics  --- Who Can It Be Now - Men at Work  --- You're My Best Friend - Queen  --- (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman - Aretha Franklin  ---  --- Final Verdit: Run don't walk to buy Karaoke Revolution Party! 	pos
I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it	neg

The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio, but it has 2 issues. ---  --- The Good: The talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on. It is nice to hear when you are rolling along, "9000 steps." The FM radio is very elementary, but functional. There is no dial to tune. You push a button and it rolls to the next station. There is a volume control on the earphones. The pedometer uses AAA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.   ---  --- The Bad: The pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor. It didn't break, but it was very annoying. Several times it popped off w/o me knowing and I left it in a restaurant or in a friend's car.  ---  --- The Ugly: If I accidentally bumped the reset button  - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day's count and went back to zero. The pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost. This would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day. Very frustrating.  ---  --- The clip broke after about 3 months -- so I retired it.  ---  --- I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have been very pleased with it. It has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband, the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor. It has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight. It has a clock. It uses a button battery. It does not have a radio and it doesn't talk, but it works and works well.  ---  --- The Sportline would be good if it had a teather, a clip that didn't break so easily, and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally.	neg

My 14 mo old son just got his go kart today.  He loves it.  He loves pushing the button and making it go.  He hasn't figured out the steering yet but we have a long straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet.  My 4 yr old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine (about 40 in tall and 35 lbs).  She received the razor go kart herself and loves it but that one is outside only.  They have had the best time today playing with the PW go kart.  I agree with other reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones but they figure out ways to get around it.  (The razor go-kart also has a thumb throttle control)  We got the Lil Quad 4 wheeler for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she didn't have the big 4-wheeler.  Now both kids can ride their 4-wheelers together or their go karts.  Thanks Santa for 2 great gifts	pos

Extremely disappointed, especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product (and the Axion 7" player) received.   ---  --- I bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv.  The player worked fine for the first DVD we tried, but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black.  You couldn't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine.  No complaints about the sound I guess, but what good is that if the screen doesn't work? ---  --- Needless to say I returned this as fast as possible.  In fact, if I could rate it less than one star I would, since it didn't even last one day. Terrible product	neg
I replaced my baby's old bumper with this one when she became mobile.  It works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats.

If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extemely dumbed-down version of MW.

I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?" ---  --- The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS. ---  --- But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack	neg

I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama.	neg

     Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings.  ---  ---      Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.   ---  ---      In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result. ---  ---      As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security. ---  ---      If you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting, please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions. 	neg

This book covers in depth the LBO of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s. Recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew I wanted to go into M&A work, I decided to read it. I thought the book was excellent, but maybe unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a top Wall Street job, this book is a must. For everyone else that just likes good non-fiction, this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era	pos
Contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has NO subtitles or closed captions or whatever. The R2 neither. ---  --- So again, don't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff. ---  --- Non anamorphic or simply 4:3 format, no subs, not available at all (yes I mean you, Disney)... In short, no quality or consistency. Go and take a hike. ---  --- Stop lobbying for legislation and start making real DVD's	pos

The Four Seasons have always been one of my favorite groups. I think Frankie Valli has one of the best voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto in existence, and the rest of the group had harmonies that only The Beach Boys could match. nd for band that has had as any hits as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits collection. Up until now, I always felt the best way to obtain all the Four Seasons' best songs was by getting Rhino's single disc "The Very Best Of The Four Seasons". Well, I was wrong. "In Season: The Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons Anthology" is the definitve Four Seasons collection. ---  --- On these two discs, you find all the essential Four Seasons songs, including "Sherry", "Big Girls Don't Cry", "Walk Like A Man", "Dawn (Go Away)", "Rag Doll", "Let's Hang On (To What We've Got)", "Working My Way Back To You", "Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)", "Tell It To The Rain" (an often forgotten Top 10 hit and my favorite Four Seasons song ever), "Who Loves You" and "December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)". But the majority of the cd is a wealth of rarities, including many songs that were either album tracks, uncharted singles or Frankie Vali solo singles. Plus, you get it for about $25.00, which I consider fairly cheap for a cd with 51 songs.  ---  --- The 30+ page booklet is excellent, filled with track information (chart positions, etc.), rare photos and an excellent essay written by Pat Sierchio. This is an absolute must have	pos
This is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of America.  In fact, the real star of the show, asie from the ubiquitous red Ford Taurus, is the scenery of America itself.  The camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics.  Unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene, but the point of the series is to give a "Reader's Digest" view of places people can visit. ---  --- But excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series. Each "trip" is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral "family vacations" combined into a one hour program. This is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm	pos

This cd has so much going on and going for it - it's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans.  Lee Ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks.  He's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right.  ---  --- "Blue in Green" is one of my favorite jazz compositions by Miles Davis and Ernie Watts on tenor sax more than does it justice.  "Ocean Ave." is as breezy and beachy as I think it's meant to be.   ---  --- My favorite tracks are easily "She Walks this Earth" (Ivan Lins' vocals are bossa nova beautiful), "Blue in Green" and predictably for me "Papa was a Rolling Stone" with powerful, crystal clear, unique trumpet by Chris Botti and soulful, rhythmic vocals by Kenya Hathaway and Grady Harrell. I went looking for that track because I am transfixed by Chris Botti's trumpet and what I found was a remarkable cd in its entirety.  Happy me.  ;	pos
We caught this movie on PBS when it first came on, and my daughter was hooked.  It's a change from the regular Arthur animation - this one is computer animated.  She was very intrigued by that fact, and then the story is about a puppy... well there you go!  The story is well written, a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after Pal.  There are even a few catchy tunes as well.  Highly recommend this to every Arthur fan out there	pos

I can't say enough about Illustory!  My daughter is 6 and in Kindergarten and loved to make stories on paper stapled together. So, Santa brought her an Illustory kit and we did it together as she can't write many of the words yet.  So, she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to story to say.  We got our book in the mail yesterday, and she was so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book!  The quality was great, and it even had the dedicaton page and an "about the author" page with her picture (which I provided).  We even ordered an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her!  I highly reccomend this kit	pos
My daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  It combines the classic board and memory games together.  The pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable.  The only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily.  We have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box.  An excellent game!!	pos
I used two tubes in one month - one for daytime wear, and one for nighttime and when I wasn't going out (clear).

If they lower the price by $10-12, I will buy it again......but not until they do :-	neg
If you have read Harmon's acting resume online, then you know she has talent, she has the training, and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along.  But being a mild conservative (Angie is a Republican) in Liberal Hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at.  Good Advice was Bad advice for her.  It is miscast with two annoying stars; Sheen and Richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie.  It has no redeaming values at all and Angie deserves better roles then this.  This movie was made by Artiscan Films, which recently went into bankruptcy and is now Lions Gate Films, their films are still bad no matter the name change, and I still wait to see a better movie come to Angie Harmon	neg
According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked. That other /b adapter, BTW, gives better throughput than this /b/g card of D-Link's	neg

What happened to this book?  It is a disgrace to the star wars universe.  It's practically a Star Wars dictionary, that's all.  In spite of the good pictures, this book was very disappointing!!!	neg
First, let me say, I LOVE Koyaanisqatsi, the original film in this trilogy. Koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth. --- The second film in the trilogy, Powaqqatsi, wasn't as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another. --- Naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war. Instead, it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation, nothing more. If not for Philip Glass' music, I would not have given this film any rating at all. --- I write this criticism in hopes that Godfrey Reggio sees it. He should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us, as clearly as he did with "Koy", why war (the topic of "Naq") is so horrific. If you want an effective critique of violence, try "Clockwork Orange". Naqoyqatsi is simply a mess	neg
The item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve.  I ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completley --- different diaper.

I am rather picky, but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage, but also the name.  They were not what I was expecting when they arrived.

I would not recommend.	neg

What a great album this is, not only is the music a real pleasure to listen to, but the lyrics are a hoot! Wayne is not afraid to experiment, he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way.

I ordered these for my 18 month old daughter, and was a little nervous, I had never bought earrings on line before, I wanted something with the safety backs, but I had expereince with some backs that "screw themselves off".

I finally got a Snow Brum after living in the northeast my whole life.  I can't believe I've wasted so much time with a regualr snow brush.

You can clean off your entire car in about 1/10th of the time.  And this is great for the deep snows too.  In short, if you have snow - YOU NEED THIS	pos
The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo.  I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries.  However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem.  There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front.  So, I have no problem with the seller. 	neg
This compass fails to do the one simple task I purchased it for, which is simply telling me which direction I am going.  ---  --- I spent $[...] for a [...] compass made out of crap materials. It works only for the direction you set it at. For example if you set it while facing north, it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions, the result is completely random.... ---  --- This compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually (gasp) might turn. ---  --- absolute rippoff.	neg

No solo para los RPG Fans  --- --------------------------  --- Se que hay muchos que no gustan de los RPG's, de hecho yo mismo no soy fan de estos. Asi que al empezar a jugar Oblivion lo hice solo por curiosidad, por probar que tan buenas eran las graficas y el gameplay. Al principio no me pareci� gran cosa... pero cuando sales la primera vez a campo abierto... Incre�ble! te quita el aliento. Una vez empiezas a recorrer todo el reino de Tamriel el juego te atrapa y cr�anme no puedes esperar el momento de regresar y seguir explorando este gigantesco mundo lleno de secretos y maravillas.  --- Cuando pienses en Oblivion, no imagines un juego tipo las Final Fantasy, o los t�picos RPG's japoneses, este es un RPG que apela a un publico mucho m�s amplio. Aquellos que gustan de juegos como zelda, o aventuras como Enclave, e incluso los fans de los juegos de sigilo como Splinter Cell, encontraran aqu� algo para ellos.  ---  --- Camino a la gloria  --- ----------------------  --- ES4: Oblivion te coloca en el Rol de un prisionero, que por alguna raz�n, fuiste parte de un sue�o del Emperador Uriel Septim en el cual tu eras el elegido para salvar a Tamriel de un oscuro grupo Daedra conocido como Mythic Dawn. De esta forma empiezas a vagar por las catacumbas ayudando a los guardias a proteger al emperador, sin embargo el emperador es asesinado y tu eres la unica esperanza de detener a este culto y cerrar las puertas de Oblivion y as� detener la invasi�n de los Daedra a Tamriel. Es en esta parte donde empiezas la personalizaci�n de tu personaje, que habilidades deseas, cuales ser�n tus fortalezas y debilidades.  --- Dependiendo te tus elecciones, podr�s ser un guerrero, un mago, un sigiloso ladron asi como pertenecer a cualquier raza que desees. Conforme avanza el juego debes ir haciendo crecer tus habilidades para poder ganar experiencia. �Como hacerlo? eso depende del tipo de personaje que escogiste, hay toda una gama de habilidades a desarrollar.  ---  --- Empaca tus cosas  --- ---------------------  --- Oblivion posee infinidad de misiones a realizar (aproximadamente 500 horas de juego), claro esta, hay una misi�n principal que es encontrar al heredero del emperador y cerrar la puertas de oblivion, sin embargo, si as� lo deseas, puedes ignorarla y tomar otras b�squedas como unirte a la Hermandad de los magos � a la de los Luchadores, pelear en la arena, ganar fama y fortuna o simplemente explorar y ayudar a los diferentes habitantes de Tamriel en sus vidas diarias. Cuando hablamos de juegos donde puedes hacer lo que quieras, ahora estaremos hablando de Oblivion.  --- El reino de Tamriel es enorme, hay muchas ciudades que visitar cada una tan diferente de la otra, los personajes parecen tener vida propia, sus problemas, discusiones, mitos, etc. Ademas de los pueblos encontraras infinidad de aldeas y mazmorras donde, explor�ndolas, descubrir�s toda clase de Items que te ayudar�n completar las tareas que hayas escogido.  ---  --- Lo bueno, lo malo y lo caro  --- -----------------------  --- En el apartado grafico Oblivion realmente te quita el aliento, los paisajes, las monta�as los bosques son simplemente impresionantes. Los �rboles se mueven con el viento, igual que el follaje. Los atardeceres y amaneceres son simplemente espectaculares, esto agregado a que puedes explorar cualquier parte de este gigantesco mundo es lo que hace a Oblivion ser una experiencia sobrecogedora de principio a fin (si es que hay fin...).  --- Sin embargo un juego tan gigantesco como este no esta libre de problemas, de vez en cuento encontraras ciertos bugs, como tu caballo flotando misteriosamente sobre una roca, etc. sin embargo son nada ante lo que le juego ofrece.  --- Y lo caro, todo tiene un precio, si realmente quieres apreciar este juego en toda su magnificencia necesitas una PC relativamente potente. Aunque hay un parche para PC's no muy potentes.  ---  --- Shut the Jaws of Oblivion!  --- ---------------------------  --- Oblivion es uno de los principales contendientes para juego del a�o, asi que no te lo pierdas es un juego fant�stico. Si estas pensando que hacer estas vacaciones te recomiendo un viaje a Tamriel y cr�anme ser�n unas vacaciones que nunca olvidaras... 	pos

Colin Firth plays a teacher and passionate to the point of obsessive football (soccer for Americans) fan who manages to mangle his only functional relationship, thanks to his tunnel vision when it comes to his obsession and fanatical support for Arsenal. His self-centered attitude with no concern at all for his girlfriend's interests muck up what could be a good relationship. On the other hand, it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about Firth's character, Paul. Perhaps because she is so uptight and needs to loosen up and sees in him a way by which to learn to be less rigid. She attempts to get involved in HIS passion but does not quite have the rabid, feverish passion he has. Eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship, but she comes to see that she likes his identity, which is strong, linked to football or not. She has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life. Of course, one could argue that this tale is a sad reflection on the idea that there is a genderlect and that women suffer more in terms of being able to communicate, but that belies the point here that sometimes an imperfect person can still be perfect for someone who loves him, faults, obsessions and all	pos
This is the best product we have ever used for our little girl (yes that includes swings and bouncy seats). I stumbled across it when they had just come out. She was sitting in it at 4 months. BY the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it. However... I see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding. I recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child. It allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster (which is a double edged sward! Tough fro parents good for kids).	pos
There's a lot of different opinions of Madden NFL 07 swirling around so I figured I get in on it as well. For my money, to just have a new football game is worth it. Seeing as how Madden is now the only football game available from year to year, if you don't like Madden's brand of video games then I feel so sorry for you. However, I think this is a great installment. By no means is this the best released but there's no doubt that it's a lot of fun. ---  --- Have Madden 06? You basically have 07. Not a lot has changed from last year. The few things are the running options (juking and whatnot) being moved to the right joystick, the 50 yard dash on the training camp, and the new camera angle for your Superstar linebacker. Also, while I've only played a quarter of an exhibition game and a lot of Superstar games, I still have yet to hear John Madden. I don't know if he's not on this game or not, but if he isn't that just makes no sense. ---  --- Pros: --- It's still Madden --- Linebacker view --- Overall Superstar: Hall Of Fame feature --- Having all the big name rookies is kind of nice ---  --- Cons: --- It hasn't changed much from last year ---  --- Yeah, that's my only big complaint. I can't help but love this game though. If you're looking to save money then there's no huge reason to buy this unless you HAVE to play with Leinart, Young, Bush, and Williams, then by all means check this out. However, if not having those guys doesn't bother you then you really don't need this year's game	pos

I bought this item, since I always make a lot of notes from books and other papers, and don't want to type it in manually anymore. This scanner, probably like any other model, needs a little training to get it right over the paper, but once done, it really works and faster than typing! --- I dont use the addressbook or options with your GSM but they are no doubt very handy. --- I just scan in from papers, and beam it to my laptop. Both Infrared and the cable work. The cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen: the scanned text appears on the pc as you type! --- The dictionary also comes in very handy. ---  --- It must be a very complex product, but just like the Ipod or ZenXtra mp3 players: they work! --- So buy one and save some time! Excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes, or studies, or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e.g	pos

I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went.	neg

We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels. I was not going to pay $200 for a car seat/stroller combo, so we picked 2 alternatives. I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected	neg

My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.	neg
Pro --- ---  --- * Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row.  --- For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom Keyboard. --- To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row. ---  --- * The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate.  ---  --- Con --- ---  --- * The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below). ---  --- * Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap.  ---  --- The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat "while on your lap or on a non-flat surface". --- This "lock" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8" along the top of the board from the left half into the right. --- Even when locked, the keyboard doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated "V" shape after any amount of light-handed typing.  --- HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed. ---   --- * The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to "enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle. --- A quick look at the Freedom Keyboard's pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right. ---   --- * The keyboard ships with no case, as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys. ---  --- * It doesn't turn off. ---  ---  --- Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch.  ---  --- The button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch. ---  --- What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection,  the keyboard is still eating your batteries.  ---  --- The automatic "sleep mode" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard. --- Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard, you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes. ---  --- The only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly. ---  --- Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords "bluetooth keyboard". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch. ---  ---  --- For the mobile user then, in addition to the keyboard itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those  batteries. --- Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user.  --- Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row. ---  ---  --- How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me. --- All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name.  --- It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism. --- But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name.  --- If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400.  --- My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq.  ---  --- The HP Bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality.  --- Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves.	neg
My family and I tried Omaha Steaks Hamburgers about 6 months ago and have purchased 3 of these picnic packs.  You have never tasted a hot dog until you have tried one of these 3oz dogs!  I would never return to regular grocery store hot dogs!  Definitely worth the money.  The nice feature is that you can order them and have them delivered whenever you want.  Even in warm climates, whatever you order will come in a cooler and packed well with ice.  Order a couple at the beginning of the Summer, and BBQ until your heart is content	pos
This Water Jet has a button on the handle just like the WaterPic. You push it to temporarily stop the flow of water. Here's a warning: it can take a lot of finger pressure to stop the flow of water especially if you have adjusted the dial for a hard flow. If you lack ordinary strength in your fingers stay away from this machine. I don't have a finger strength problem yet several times I've squirted water all over the bathroom because somehow I hadn't pushed hard enough on the stop button. ---  --- I had purchased a WaterPik, but had trouble with it leaking, and so purchased this Conair. The WaterPik is a much better quality product. The Conair seems to be very cheaply made, and I am not very happy with it. I am going back to using my WaterPik even though it occasionally springs a leak.	neg

to start I am a very big fan of Doris Day for yeays. I had just bought the 6 DVD box set of her movies & loved that so I decided to buy this TV series. It is so awful words can't describe it. It's not because it's "dated" because I Love Lucy is alot older & sheer perfection. It's initially nice to see Doris in another genre but this first series just doesn't work for me for many reasons. The subject matters chosen are thoughtful(that's the reason I gave it TWO stars & the presence of Doris)..I'll tell you the show just bored me & I found myself fast forworded through  the last 10 episodes.the DVD extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting. There's NO new interviews with Doris(that's an old interview they put on there).I think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dog	neg

Whether enjoyed as a gift for others or yourself, there is something about the G collection that consistently leaves you wishing for just ONE more piece. The brown-and-lime faux-leather box, a treat for the eyes in itself, contains 15 pieces of what can only be described as Godiva's most ambitious and delicious chocolates to date. The 15-piece G Collection closely mirrors the more expensive "American Pies" collection, but provides many unique and otherwise unobtainable pieces that more than justify the cost of the set. ---  --- The rich, all-encompassing flavor of the G Collection's fruit pieces is on par with the "American Pies" collection: Key Lime and Cherry stand out, bursting from their fragile, sugar-coated shells with an intense and supremely enjoyable tang. A box of this size ought to last - one will quickly find that the richness (to overuse the word) marks these candies as individual luxuries to be enjoyed over time. Simply scarfing these down simply will not to justice to the complex, excellent job Godiva has done in blending different ingredients to make authentic, mouth-watering flavors. ---  --- Godiva's G Collection can never be explained satisfactorily until they are tried. Only on the tastebuds can an accurate and deserving review of these milestone candies be written	pos
I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.   ---  --- The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized?  ---  --- I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.   ---  --- The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.   ---  --- Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them. ---  --- I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry. ---  --- I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. 	neg

I made this purchase in Oct has a X-mas gift.  They arrived and at quick glance appeared to be fine.  I immediately wrapped the earrings and they were hidden away.  X-mas morning after my young daughter open her gift I more closely examined them.  One of the earrings was completely grayish in color; so dark that I would consider it to be defective.  I called the Netaya customer service phone number only to be greeted with "Hello".  After verifying that I had indeed reached Netaya I briefly explained the defect and requested that I be permitted to return the earrings.  I was placed on hold and then told that "the lady" I needed to speak with was busy and I would need to call back or send an e-mail.  I e-mailed the company twice before receiving notice that they would not accept the return because 30 days had passed since purchase.  I would not recommend	neg

One reviewer claims that this is marred by some of Eliot's unfurtunate preducices. But how come you don't say something like that about O' Henry. We can't just stop reading authers because you we don't like their views. Someone calls hemingway looking forward? If that's looking forward I'de rather look backward. Hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever. Most of the people that reviewer named justly loved Eliot. Eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past, but towards what we have made out of the present. In name of progress, we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls. To call Eliot Conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous, the first draft according to one of Eliot's biographers, was absolutly a expression of Relavtism. One critic accused him being a Nihilist.  ---  ---    On the Poem itself Eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone, not to mention his brilliant use of Imperfect rymthe. So it doesn't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets. So he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism, we could use more of that. Yet what he doesn't right he evoces through mode and tone, giving us truly one of the best poems of this, or any other century.	pos

This guy is going to become big someday.    I agree with this reviewer:  ---  --- "The songs on "Seven Swans", with a folksy bucholic feeling that runs through most of them, tell of spiritual tales. They tell of love that transcends the body and age. Sufjan can appeal equally to the Christian person as to the one who practices Zen Buddhism. And that is something few songwriters can accomplish. Keep an eye on Sufjan for years to come."  I have fun tooling around with "To Be Alone with You" on the guitar, such a simple but infectious melody.   ---  --- "SEVEN SWANS" is not over orchestrated like "Michigan" and "Illinois" seem to be.  Good song to OK song ratio is about 85 percent on this one and about 45-50 percent on the the aforementioned CD's.    "SEVEN SWANS" is a great way to get introduced to the subtle musical power and overall genius of Sufjan.   ---  --- Sufjan has all his own style and is not afraid to tell us who he is.  VERY CREATIVE...HE TRULY FORGES HIS OWN MUSICAL PATH.  CANNOT WAIT FOR HIS CD CALLED "WISCONSIN." 	pos

This is one honker of a tire pressure gauge.  Good long reach for my F350 dually tires from the rubber handle dual foot valve via a flexible hose to a meter with a big display.  After one day's use, I don't see why the display doesn't always engage, but poking it onto the valve stem gets it going OK.   ---  --- Instructions not obvious that you must remove the red strip that protects the batteries.  Also not obvious how to get to the batteries, whatever they are, but I'll figure it out.  I may try another reviewer's idea to bend it 5 degrees for easier access thru the access holes to the valve.  Gotta use it a bit longer first. ---  --- Sure is a good gauge in any case	pos

This bed was a real disappointment from the beginning. We actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it. It's just a fabric cover, perhaps with an extra layer of material, but it CAN'T be foam. Maybe only 1/4" thick at most. Then, after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4" rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally.

I bought four of these for my husabnd, son in law, daughter and myself for Christmas. I wrapped a bag of marshmallows for each of them and gave them the wrapped guns and marshmallows on Christmas eve. The second they opened the marshmallows they knew what was in the box.

They ate all the marshmallows that fell to the floor. Well, not ALL of them..I did find some in the Christmas tree and on the bookshelves. (Yes they played with them in the house.) One trick...to get the marshmallows to shoot really well, we genlty rolled them in our hands from side to side to make the mallow just a bit skinnier. Stale marshmallows work great too	pos
I added this toy to my son's xmas list. With much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! I would not say that it's a "fun to play with" toy but the entertainment value still exists. The planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling. They glow at night..which is the best part !! At 36 years old I can't wait for  nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the  planets!  The stars the set comes with are perfect. They are NOT the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night. They are paper stickers that disappear during the day (on the celing they do anyway) The planets come with name stickers which adds educational value. My son is five and LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these planets. I say get 'em !! ---  ---  Lisa Avilio-Meyer	pos

This movie has a good plot, great acting, and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life. I did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other, but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos, the profanity, the undermining of parental authority, and the lack of closure concerning Landon's journey to faith. It is evedent that this movie is directed to a less-than-mature-audience. I saw more bad in it than good, which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie	neg
This is a great finisher - use after you've drenched your hair with leave-in conditioner, and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape.

Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial.  It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth.  Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing.  I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing. ---  --- This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model.  Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap	neg
The kneeling stool is great.  The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful!   BUT...the elbow pad is a joke!  There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic.  Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all.  It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it.  I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail	neg

"Breaking Away" is a true rarity: a feel-good movie that doesn't that isn't silly. Yes, there are plenty of laughs in it, but they're the result of great acting and writing, not the cheap, crude one-liners that litter so many of today's so-called "comedies." And while the movie will tug at your heartstrings, it never spills over into gooey sentimentality or empty pathos. ---  --- But I also feel sort of sad whenever I watch "Breaking Away." The small-town downtown where the guys hang out is just a fading memory for most Americans. And are there any old swimming holes anymore, like the quarry that the characters visit? Or have they all been paved over, for "luxury" McMansion subdivisions? ---  --- Shut me up! Just watch "Breaking Away" and enjoy it	pos

I really tried to like this game, being that EA chickened out and bought their way out of competition. ---  --- The graphics and sound are great in this game, but its ruined by EA's cheating AI. I have never seen a game cheat this much in my life. No matter what play you call the defense always knows what you are calling, even if you think you have them beat on a play, your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his nitrous oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in 2 seconds to deflect a pass. If you throw a high pass, not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump 10 feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do.  ---  --- If you QB is going back for a pass and a lineman is 3 feet away from you, even if you press the passing button, your QB will just stand there so he can take a sack. This game is total BS, there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure becuase the game forces you into a tackle animation.  ---  --- When you are playing defense, you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the CPU pulls of BS miracle plays on every single down. Remember how I said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes? Not the CPU receivers, the CPU receivers, regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time. if they don't catch it, the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it. Think you stopped a 3rd down conversion? Think again, you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penatly. And remember about your QB being forced into a tackle animation? Not the CPU, the CPU can get of 60 yard spirals while he's being hit!  ---  --- What about the inconsistency you ask? Well let me explain. How is it that one game you can be totally on, but the next game, you can't even complete ONE pass! I'll tell you why. The CPU wants you to lose, so you will drop every pass, fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book. I was playing a game, and managed to run back a punt and KR for a TD, before my offense even touched the field. Then all of a sudden the CPU turned on its God Mode and every thing went right for the CPU. BS lobs, BS runs and BS calls. I did not complete ONE SINGLE pass in the entire first half. Its not because the CPU was playing good defense, its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them, wide open or not. I ended up only completing one pass in the entire game, 1 for 20 I think. At this point, I knew I had no chance of winning, so I just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration. My so called impact RB only got 2 yards on 20 rushes, and my so called impact CB gave up 3 TD passes to a below average receiver. What is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win?  ---  --- Yes you can win games as I have, but it is so inconsistent. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose, nothing you can do about it. ---  --- I see why EA bought the license, after putting out crap like this, they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better AI, instead of this cheating crap. I am taking this game to the store for store credit and I am done with EA for good. EA sucks and so does this game	neg

The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas.  When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips.  Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them.    I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these.  ---  --- Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause	neg
Most of the other reviews printed here I am in agreement with.  There is little I need to add except that I saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape.  I just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some.  Schlesinger's work, the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing, sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek "happiness" in all of the wrong places -- especially in the wrong people.  After the twenty-odd years of first viewing this film, I realized tonight how strong Julie Christie's performance is in this film.  There is not one hole in this bravura performance.  It's odd to make this statement, especially since she's playing such a shallow role.  It's not an easy nor a desirable part to play, but she carries it off as if she herself were the character.  Selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity, and she stoops and conquers. ---  --- Laurence Harvey has never played the rogue better and Dirk Bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart, but nevertheless gives in (but not completely) to Ms. Christie's empty needs.  He, indeed, sees through her throughout most of the film but cannot help being swayed by her charms. ---  --- Emptiness served up brilliantly.  And we must respect the talents involved for providing us with a lesson -- as well as thank them (on two levels at least: talent coupled with making us examine what should really be of value to us)	pos
As the previous reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the KLIC-5001 1700 mAh battery as described in the Product Details, it is the lower capacity (1050 mAh) KLIC-5000.  ---  --- At least it is the Kodak battery, if that matters to you. (I have a new Kodak camera and want to protect the warranty.)  If not, plenty of places sell the generic KLIC-5001 for less than Amazon sells the Kodak KLIC-5000	neg
I bought the game couple of weeks ago. I was hesitating on buying it initially, but finally I did because of all the good hype about the game. I wish I didn't buy it. ---  --- To be fair, I have to admit that the game has astonishing landscape, cities and the level of details in the game. I don't think I have ever seen suhc creativity and perfectness in earlier games. I am sure that are lot of people that will find such features enaough for them to adore the game. ---  --- For me, landscape is not enough since the largest downside is the story, if there is any story, "from my perspective". I have abandoned playing after closing the 4th or 5th Oblivion gate. I don't see any excitment in playing the game any further. I explored most of the cities though, quite quickly. The conversation looks silly that every time the camre will zoom in to the person you are chating with. It was nice the first couple of times but then .... ---  --- I am waiting for my sweet gothic3 to go out. Honestly I would prefer playing Gothic1 on playing oblivion. Just to tell you about the action/excitment I am talking about, I would like to say that when I got gothic2 I played for almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water and play play and lots of play. --- 	neg

This is a very neat hammock. It is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of. It does of course not allow air to flow through like a rope hammock, but is so much more comfortable.

I roll mine up and bring it inside when I'm not using it, which is quick and easy to do and will make it last that much longer. It will hold to adults, but is a little crowded	pos

I am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible. I took about 400 shots with my Digital Rebel XT and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that I immediately returned it / got a refund.  ---  --- In all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus. In many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it's entire range. Since most of my photography is of animals I simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots. ---  --- I tested the autofocus against my Canon 18-55 EF-s (packaged with the Rebel XT) and a Canon 75-300 EF. In every instance where the Tamron could not focus the Canon lenses had no problem! When the Tamron would focus I found the pictures were not as sharp as my Canon lenses. Again I'm far from an expert however I was only printing 4x6 photos. ---  --- I replaced the Tamron with a Quantaray(Sigma) 55-200 DC which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality(for amatuers..)  ---  --- Bottom line.. It was hard to part with the Tamron because I was really enthused about the zoom range however I would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that doesn't. I have read many reviews with the same problem noted. Tamron needs to get thier act together	neg
This app is just horrendous. It is literally NOTHING more than a moving map; I'm serious. There are NO features at all. To make things worse, when zoomed out, the display is littered with the names of every little village and hamlet you've never heard of, leaving the names of recognizable towns a cities nowhere to be found. Also, at these zoom levels, most roads, streets and highways are not visible, making navigation impossible. This app does not even come close to qualifying as a GPS nav system. Even as a 'moving map' it's pretty well useless unless you're zoomed into about 300 yards. Even though this app was a freebie included with Trips and Streets 2005 (which is a VERY nice, capable app.), it's still maddening that Microsoft would allow such a eggregiously lame program to be released. If it were possible to give this program negative stars AND charge Microsoft with a crime, I'd do it in a heartbeat	neg

I am a BR5-49 aficionado from the early days at Robert's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks.  Admittedly, I long for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League Baseball.  So I'm nostalgic, "IT'S A FREE COUNTRY."  It is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels.  Yet, whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has "matured," I can do nothing but cringe.  Here's the flowchart:  Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub. - Band gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management supplied by label - Band gets "coached" in next recording - Band changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity - Band produces new "mature" album - Band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process. --- Gee, I sure hope this isn't how the end of BR5-49 comes about, but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion.  This record is OK.  Of course, I realize that any band can't just re-hash the same 'ol stuff on every album, but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl.  One part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals, and a simple taste of this is what I sorely miss in the last few recordings.  This band live used to be a wild, jittery, moving organism on stage, and although they are still a solid live show (saw them on the last tour at Poor David's Pub in Dallas), something has settled down. Chuck is a great talent, but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of Chuck and Gary Bennett. Ok, I'll go cry me a river, but dammit, just go listen to the Big Backyard Beat Show one more time.  Mature?  I just don't want to grow up that bad	neg

Some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the Nikon 8400 has a "electronic viewfinder" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so I bought the camera. ---  --- The electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  Outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot.  ---  --- The "display" LCD monitor is small and washes out in sunlight. ---  --- The background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark. ---  --- After 3 days of use and 90 shots I mailed it back to "Ritz on Amazon" this morning, Dec 5.  They require it back "within 10 days of receipt of purchase", their "date of order" was Nov 29 and it arrived at my house on Dec 3.  It's a good thing I already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if I had waited for the one I ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  It cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a "delivery confirmation receipt". ---  --- The camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the "10 days" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what I was shooting I gave up on it	neg
This is an endurance test. As in 'bitches brew''live evil''love at the Fillmore' latter day Miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium. It makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. Take 'yesternow' it takes for ever for Billy Cobham to find a beat. This is just self indulgence of the worse kind, a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers. Miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music. This album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period. McGaughlin's guitar though breathtaking in the Mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs, totally without any structure and fire (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with Miles) Disjointed would be too kind a word. When you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). Miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. Maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant, but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess	neg
Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product	neg

This is a very nice watch. The pink mother-of-pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft. The date is a little small but the watch is so nice that I didn't even care. The only complaint I have is that Amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside. I had to get a new battery on my own, but as soon as I told Amazon, they credited me the $10. That was great, but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. Otherwise, the watch is highly recommended. Even nicer than in the photo	pos
If you could condense heaven into a colorful, 3" diameter sphere, it would be a peach.  They are candies that grow on trees, are picked by angel-elves, and teleported directly to your local grocery store to avoid blemishes.  One day I was eating a peach while walking downhill and caused a peach-juice-slide.  Everybody on the sidewalk jumped on the slide and it carried them down to a radiant peach-pool at the bottom, which everyone splashed into with a wave of orgasmic bliss. --- Said best by the Presidents of the United States of America,  "Nature's candy in my hand, can or pie.	pos
Following up on the success of The Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder, this is the second volume in the Hannah Swenson Murder Mysteries.  Here again, we find Hannah coping with the brutal Minnesota winter when the unthinkable happens.  Hannah finds a body!  The local high school coach and secret wife beater is found dead face down in Hannah's strawberry shortcake.  His wife certainly has a motive, but is she the real killer?  The police are inclined to think so, but Hannah certainly does not.  With the aide of her sister, Andrea, she sets out to find the real killer.  Many suspenseful twists and turns follow as Hannah and Andrea proceed on their relentless mission to free an innocent woman.  Will they succeed and find the real killer?  Only in the last few chapters will you find out the answer to this riddle. ---  --- Once again, author Joanne Fluke has surpassed herself with another excellent novel.  The cozy and inviting atmosphere found in the first novel continues here against the backdrop of the cruel Minnesota cold.  Many delicious recipes are included so you can share the experience right along with Hannah and her friends.  Her strained relationship with her mother continues as her friendship with Norman grows and her closeness to her sister Andrea deepens.  The novel keeps you in suspense right up until the very end providing an exhilarating mystery ride.  This is a novel not to be missed.  Very highly recommended. ---  --- Smash 	pos

Don't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch.  This monitor is sold as "providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout".

Being a big fan of anime comedy (the intelligent, yet lame humor) I was eager to see El Hazard "The magnificent world". Because of the high price of the set, I had some hesitation (because of some poor reviews on Amazon).  ---  --- Well, I have to say that the bad reviews are wrong. This DVD series was totally awesome (although I admit it started a bit slow). I promise the more you keep watching, the better it gets. The plot is highly intelligent (involving dimensional and time travel) and the characters are very interesting (with distinctive special powers). ---  --- Some say the humor in El Hazard is juvenile (but I would argue no more juvenile then southpark), and seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile?  ---  --- Some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant (because many episodes involve a doomsday device), to which I respond "Do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star"? no, ofcourse not.  ---  --- yes this DVD set lacks some extras, but I think Pioneer did a great job. The DVD menu presentation is beautiful, and the box is very elegant too. Hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on Ebay (beware of bootlegs). It's very hard to find a good authentic set. The sequel "alternative world" which I just ordered, individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart. ---  --- For my fellow anime comedy fans, I also reccomend "Niea under 7" and "His and Her Circumstances".  ---  --- animation=5 --- plot=4 --- music=4 --- characters=5 --- comedy=4 ---  --- Total= 4.4 Star	pos

This is an absolutely awesome product!   I purchased a new car 5 months ago and vowed to keep it looking great.  I found out that Meguiar's makes premium car care products.   ---  --- Here's what I like about it.  It sprays on smoothly and gets off the surface dirt.  (You know, the green pollen that is falling on my new car this time of year?)  It wipes off easily with a paper towel or terrycloth. Also, it leaves the car smelling great.   ---  --- It is only used on the car's exterior.  For the rest of the car there is a whole line of Meguiar's products.  I also bought the leather cleaner and car shampoo which I will review later. ---  --- So for all you guys and gals who want the car looking terrific in between washes, I highly recommend this product. 	pos

I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s, and they just suck in comparison. ---  --- The Bass is non existent in comparison, and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny.

The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling...	neg
My youngest brother, who has a pretty strange sense of humor, bought me this CD for my birthday; I wonder how he knew I didn't own it already? I don't even know where to begin with this one. What can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere.  ---  D-  Tom Rya	neg
Firstoff, that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong.  Let me explain how this works. ---  --- The soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like iTunes; it has its own proprietary format that is really just MP3 with a different file extension title.  When you import your MP3s into the soundstage library, it makes its own DUPLICATE library of your music in a new directory using its 'OMG' file suffix.  Yes, OMG.  I think that's funny, and you should too. ---  --- The minidiscs themselves are essentially just CD-RWs.  Keep this in mind.  They are enjoyable cheap to buy more, they are rewritable, and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio, or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate' audio, which is just compressed MP3s.   ---  --- The product itself is very good.  I've had one for a short while.  I bought an eight-pack of disks right after I got it, and filled them with music.  I have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is FAR less irritating than my old cd-player method; CD-swapping with 70-minute albums.   ---  --- The controls are VERY simple and effective.  Grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate, but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-CD.  Its impeccably shockproof, and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight.  The hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light. ---  --- I got this as an alternative to harddrive MP3 jukeboxes.  Most MP3 players over a gig in capacity are HD storage, which is far less durable (in my experience) than simpler players.  Rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that I would have to swap on my computer constantly, I got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me.  Its a solution that suited me well	pos

As a character movie this is largely a failure, unless you find poignancy in "average-ness." The characters are all one-note half-stereotypes who seem to be sleeping their way through the non-existent plot. "Oh, look how average they are! Isn't it charming how they sit around and talk about nothing? It's so lifelike!" And the main character's seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her. --- If this is intended to be an issue movie with the message Robert Ebert has suggested (that anti-abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women), it's taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows. Munich and Syriana also "bring to light" ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world. Perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things. Perhaps next they'll make a movie to make the point that, shockingly enough, the sky is blue, or that paint dries when applied to walls, or that grass grows. I imagine they'd be somewhat more interesting than this effort	neg

Well, the Hansen Gas-Mate II Quick Disconnect Adapter will temporarily solve your BBQ connection issues, but ONLY TEMPORARILY.  What will inevitably happen to you will be suffering my fate.  Upon emptying your tank, you are going to find someday that you will have this adapter stuck in the threads of the tank.  There is no place to grab the adapter with a wrench or pliers to get a good grip on it to turn it. ---  --- Save that little plastic inner piece that comes with it as you can get an adjustable wrench around the square outside of that to turn the adapter out for a while, until the day comes when the torque required is too much for the plastic inner piece.  I would also recommend greasing up both sets of threads, the ones on the new tank and the ones on the Hansen Gas-Mate II adapter.  AND DON'T OVERTIGHTEN IT putting it into your new full tank. ---  --- This adapter is another bad design by Weber.  This adapter should come with either a strong metal inner piece that helps you remove it, or it should have some portion of the adapter itself on its outside that operates like a nut and serves as a grabbing point for a wrench	neg

I don't often watch foreign films.  The reason being, as an American, I don't feel that I can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works.  French....  Spanish....  German...  etc.... regardless of nationality, genre, or time period, they generally leave me cold.    ---  --- With that in mind, I went into this with no doubts as to the film's greatness, but again, didn't think as an American I would be able to see it, as the situational nuances would be lost on me.   As it turned out, I was wrong, and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily, and didn't seem obtuse or "foreign".   The experience could best be likened to watching "The Graduate", as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations, but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching.  ---  --- I won't recap the storyline, or discuss details of the movie itself, I just wanted to say that I went into this skeptical, expecting to find a picture that I couldn't relate to, but what I found was an immediate, compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition. --- 	pos

After having trouble with a different atomic clock, I decided to try again.  I chose the LaCrosse Atomic clock after reading other reviews from customers and searching online.  Overall, it's been great.  I was able to quickly set it up in my office; the instructions are simple and easy to follow.  My office is in a NYC commercial building, mostly made of mortar and brick with a steel frame.  Initially, I did not receive the signal in the day.  But the instructions pointed out that the signal is strongest at night, and the clock would most likely set at night.  Sure enough, the next morning, it was correctly set (even with the earlier daylight savings time).  I've found the black background with white numbers particularly easy to read from a distance.  My only concern was the same as that of other customers: Amazon packed it poorly, and the inner box holding the clock was totally free to bounce around in the outer box.  Fortunately, the outer box protected it enough, and the clock arrived unscathed.  Overall, I consider myself lucky, given the condition of many boxes delivered to my office building.  Otherwise, this is a nice, accurate, easy to read clock with a sense of style, as well	pos

I have tried many contact lens solutions, and this one works the best for me.  Since switching to Acuvue 2 disposable lenses a couple of years ago, I noticed that my eyes did not maintain their moisture as well as with my former daily wear lenses.  Some solutions burned my eyes even after rinsing my lenses in saline, but the OptiFree is truly different for me, helping to clean my lenses daily and seemingly helping to maintain their flexibility and comfort all day.  Although I still rinse the OptiFree off of my lenses with saline before wearing them, I have found no irritation.  And, even better, daily rinsing and overnight storage in the OptiFree help me to extend the life of my disposable lenses for several weeks beyond what I could without using it.  That saves money because I have to purchase lenses less frequently.  Give it a try, especially at this price!  Wow	pos

This is the most technically excellent racing sim I have played. The physics are perfect, the graphics are pleasing, and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars. The learning curve can be very steep, but you can adjust the AI to suit your needs. You can also turn on traction control, steering aids, etc., which will get you into the game faster. After a couple months, you'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven. There is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing. If you want a realistic racer, buy this game	pos

...and they are working out great with our Thomas Layouts.  Melissa & Doug products continue to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great educational value.  These are educational and your children will learn things like Police Station, Fire Station, Hospital, School, Town Hall, Grocery Store, and Post Office.  There are several different shapes too, including squares, rectangles, triangle, and the various signs.  The buildings and most of the roof pieces only have the building design on one side.  The trees, ambulance, fire truck, and mail truck are large and double sided.  The various street signs, and passenger cars are a little small, and as the box states ages 3+ and up, I would consider these smaller pieces a choking hazard.  The larger pieces are enjoyed by both my 1 yr old and my 3 yr old.  The rectangles are the largest piece in the set and measure 4 3/4 by 2 1/4" approx.  Squares are roughly 2 1/4 x 2 1/4".  These blocks are not as heavy as I expected, but still nicely made, and bright colorful additions to playsets like Thomas/Brio train sets.  If your children don't insist on the real thing, this is a great way to save some money and still buy a quality product.   --- The only drawback is the wooden storage box doesn't come with a sliding plexi cover like the Melissa & Doug pizza set or beading set does.

We are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks.  We bought the mattress for our Delta Marisa White Crib, and (you guessed it) it doesn't fit.  I read the review of another poster here and it says it doesn't fit their Thomas The Tank Engine toddler bed. The poster assumed that it may fit a baby's crib, but the honest truth; its one inch (possibly more) off.  An inch is enough for our baby's foot to get stuck in it, and the mattress feels like a joke, its too cushiony.  We regret not reading the reviews before buying it. ---  --- If this mattress doesn't fit the majority of cribs/beds, then what is it good for	neg
Here's my theory in regards to how one should rate a remix album: If a song is remixed, then that remix should be better than the original song. Otherwise, what's the point? ---  --- With that being said, Nu-Mixx Klazzics is pretty much pointless. This is nothing more than a cash in album. The people at Death Row/Koch know that folks will continue to buy Pac's music as long as you can manage to put a new spin on it (especially the die hards...they'll buy anything associated with the man). Well, the spin they put on this particular album is just plain terrible. ---  --- If you have the source material, stick with that. These "remixes" don't make the originals better, they actually make them worse. The beats sound like throw away beats from an old JT Tha Bigga Figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered/changed so that they sound updated (removing Snoop from "2 of Amerikka's Most..." and distorting Pac's vocals when he says his name is just terrible), but these changes are only for the worst. In short, all aspects of this album are sorry. The guests are wack and the beats are generic, hollow, "clubby" beats. Remember y'all, when these albums were dropped back in '96 the beats had more meat to them. ---  --- There is one decent track though. "Life Goes On" gets a different look and I'm not so sure that it's all that bad. I find it tolerable, but I could see why why someone wouldn't like it. But this is coming from someone that wasn't all that crazy about the original because I wasn't feeling the beat. If you enjoyed the original, then stick with that. Also, I like that the original version of "Hit 'Em Up" was used here. In this version, 'Pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that he was cool with (thus proving that he wasn't anti - east coast, just anti - Bad Boy). ---  --- Whoever gave the green light to have this released should be fired. It's a shame that folks are pimping Tupac's music like this. But they'll continue to do it as long as folks continue to buy it. I'm drawing the line here. Shame on you, Suge. Your label isn't relevant anymore, get over it and move on. ---  --- Standout Tracks: Don't even waste your time looking for an	neg

AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound. ---  ---  If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"  ---  ---  At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process. ---  ---  Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane	neg

Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever! ---  --- Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting	neg
Unlike any other game you've ever played--in the best possible way. I am easily bored and/or grossed out by the traditional racing, shooting, killing zombie games and this game was a refreshing change.  --- Challenging enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time. Other reviewers have said it ends too soon, but the game lets you repeat each level to beat your previous best score. So, if you barely beat the level, you can do it over until you have totally blown it out of the water. Perfect for a pair of obsessive-compulsives like my fianc� and me.  --- He thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than I do AND his 6-going-on-7-year-old-son loves it, too. There isn't anything that would be inappropriate for any age, but a kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn't get it. (After he goes to bed we play the insanely gory Jaws game--you get to be the SHARK!!)  --- You might think that rolling up stuff to make a big ball would get old fast, but the King of All Cosmos keeps it exciting with the challenges and surprises. The levels just get cooler and cooler. --- Also, the music is fantastic. It will have you singing along in no time.  Na na na na na na na na KATAMARI DAMASHI! It doesn't even make sense but I love it! --- I just ordered the second Katamari game, "We Love Katamari." `Nuff said.	pos
A mind-opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from, this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy *and* a degree in psychology. (Although I'm not giving up the meds just yet). I'm amazed by how clearly Yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have. The case histories he describes are priceless. ---   ---  On the "negative" side, Yapko can be just a bit condescending at times; it's clear he thinks his way is the only way. And although he mentions other theories of depression, he favors the "nurture" theory of ineffective learned thought patterns, claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature. (Maybe next lifetime he'll be a woman and get to experience menopause. ;) ---   ---  Yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people "depressives," which is the kind of labeling we could do without.  ---   ---  The most serious criticism I have is that his "Learn by Doing" exercises are sometimes impractical, if not downright silly. For example, to learn about perceived control, Yapko writes, "spend a few days asking [a partner] for permission to do everything, such as 'Can I go to the bathroom?'". (Can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day?) Other exercises tell you to "interview at least a dozen people" or "sometime when you feel playful, experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things" like flying. What depressed person feels playful? Many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing, and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person's capabilities--especially those of us who are "older" and have physical disabilities. However, I do plan to complete the written exercises.  ---   ---  Having outlined these minor drawbacks, I have to say it's an excellent book--after all these years, I finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression.	pos
                I appreciate bands like Ima Robot, Film School and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into Alternative music, or at least I appreciate Film School for trying to merge the beauty of Electronica with Alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the New Wave you loved in the 80's. The thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band. Have you heard Depeche Mode's albums with a wind of Boards of Canada? ---  ---                 Call this the album that it would have made more sense for Maximo Park to create if you will but this album is America's response to all other international bands showing us off hard. (The band is from San Francisco, I believe) And their influence for this album is a mix of Electronica and 80's music (My Bloody Valentine. New Order? Depeche Mode?) all leading them to create an album that doesn't quite call the band in question an American Radiohead per se, but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars, accompanying keyboards, and a leaders effort to push the band forward, a band that is trying to reach heights of originality.  ---  ---                 Film School's debut (if you aren't counting their imported EP) kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating "On and On" that may force your urge to name this band after Interpol and Elefant and a little bit of The Bravery in there, too, but will not let you throughout this entire album. Their current single "Pitfalls" may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back New Wave these days, but worse can happen for a band like this. The backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference. The second actual interlude "Garrison" is where Boards of Canada's wind starts blowing through the CD, before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of "cool". If there is ever an album to chase after and count on for the safety of New Wave and the health of Alternative, I don't see a better candidate for leg-ups than Film School's latest. ---  --- Rating: 7.5/1	pos

This movie was only slightly better than your basic horror cliche; the nuclear testing/mutant premise seemed promising, but all the main characters were stupid/annoying.  Seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters, the script-writers/director threw in lots of unnecessary gore.  For the most part, though, the special effects were at least well-done; however, a few of the effects were somewhat misguided.  For instance, blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red; wouldn't it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat??  Acting was mediocre.  I've never seen the original, so I cannot say whether this is better or worse.  The movie is not for the faint-of-heart simply because of the gore, but it definitely wasn't very scary.  Two stars	neg
I love it; I am a 55-year old woman in pretty good shape and I was able to get it out of the box and assembled completely by myself. It arrived very very quickly.

These earrings are perfect! Perfect in size, color and weight. They're not much bigger then a quater and very light, in a beautiful white gold shine.

It's pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we're seeing... ---  --- In short, for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras (Panasonic DMC-FZ50, Fuji S9100) you can have this camera with the 2 kit lenses. I imagine that you'll be very satisfied for paying the difference. ---  --- 8MP with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $650 as of 4/2007, and an upgrade path to the E-510 for all the lenses and accessories. Once you make that upgrade, what's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing. That's 10MP, IS in-body, SSWF and live-view. ---  --- IMHO, even if you're an "entry-level" DSLR user, spend the extra $400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens. The 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens, with no real peers in the entry-level DSLR range as a kit lens that I could see without going 3rd party. This lens put Olympus over the edge for me. For that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range (28-300mm), I'm not sure what else can compete on price.  --- If you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom, you could cough up the $800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5, and even then, that's a very, very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range. ---  --- The camera has full manual controls, as expected from a DSLR, and can drive a newbie like me nuts, but can also keep it simple with it's auto mode and numerous scene settings (which I use a good deal). ---  --- If you get this camera, IMHO, don't bother with the xD cards. They are very slow in comparison to the less expensive CF cards in this camera. ---  --- When it comes time to get a flash, go the extra mile and get the Olympus FL-36 over the FL-20. I'm not sure that the FL-50's warranted at this price point. I was lucky to find one cheap, so I didn't have to research 3rd party flashes. ---  --- I confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-ISO samples from this camera to the Canons and Nikons of the world. It's definitely not bad in direct comparison, but after you're done resizing and touching up the photos, you'll never notice, IMHO. On the down side, the RAW files (.ORF) don't seem to be compressed, and they're not exactly small at 14MB. ---  --- All in all, not much to complain about here	pos
I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed.  The quality is very cheap and it wasn't a perfect fit.  I am surprised that this is made by Graco - usually their products are good.  I would not recommend buying this. I would buy a regular crib sheet instead.	neg

I just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday, I was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - I was surprised because I hadn't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air, when I realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry.  Like Seventh Generation's lavender laundry detergent, I love this product - if you use them in tandem, not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender (not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products), but they come out clean and soft.  I especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it's gentle enough to use on my baby's clothes, too!  I love that it's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil.  It's also safe for my septic system, so I'm sold on this product.  If you're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or can't find one that smells good to you, try this one! 	pos

This is a wonderful device. Build quality is typical of HTC, meaning very good. The call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with AMR-HR kicking in). The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate "geek" phone). The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile, but IMHO it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. In general, things work as they are supposed to with this phone. ---  --- One drawback is that while the device does support the Bluetooth A2DP profile (stereo bluetooth sound), the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible. The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono, which means you'll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth. The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality, which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve. And even after all of that, there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio. In other words, don't waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously. However, the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular (mono/one ear) BT headsets (I recommend the Jawbone), and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable. ---  --- Another audio related drawback of this device: There is not even a 2.5mm stereo jack. The only physical audio out is through HTC's proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack. The saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable, and also the availability of HTC-to-3.5mm jack adapters on the market. ---  --- Even with a few shortcomings, I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market. It packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor. If you're in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices, this is your phone	pos

These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.	neg
 --- I got this for my 9 year old pounding the desk daughter.  She really likes it and I like it too.  Sounds are adequate and it offers some pre-recorded beats (hundreds) that are fun to plug in and play along with my guitar. --- I'm not sure she could become a great drummer with this alone but, it comes with a DVD and gives you a nice adequate beat pad for playing along with the radio or tv and for the price..was a great choice. ---  --- Where's the electrical chord guys??????

If you're like me, you get the occasional zit at the most inopportune time. BeneFit's Boo Boo Zap! is a bit spendy for such a small amount (about the size of a small tube of lipstick) but it does help. While it won't erase the zit overnight, it will get the red out. You can dab some on under or over makeup too because it goes on clear, not tinted. Definitely worth a try	pos
I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again.

I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the battery box is very poorly designed.  Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open.  Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out!  ---  --- My second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad.  The sounds quality is poor and it doesn't always sound like a dog	neg
My 2yr old got this one and another Imaginext Dinosaur for Christmas and this one is by far his favorite. He loves attaching the cart to the Mammoth and moving them around.  ---  --- The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy. When you think it's pushed down all the way, you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise. Also, like the last reviewer I think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean. But overall the toy is fun and very durable	pos

I do like this organizer, since the stroller I have doesn't have any holders on itself (for the "pusher").   There is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder.   I don't have any problem with this organizer at all but I put it at 4 stars because I would like to say that the majority of time that I'm out using the stroller, I'm with another adult who could also use a drink holder.  We're used to the Graco-designed strollers that DO come with 2 drink holders.  It's not the end of the world that someone holds their drink...but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink.  :-	pos
My daughter Morgane, who is now 8 years old, has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy (yes, there is such a thing, unfortunately). --- The symptoms are very impressive, she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes. She cannot move or open her eyes. It makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to "get dizzy". We tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down, to no avail. Morgane's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines, and we try to avoid giving Morgane medication as she is so young. So I thought of using RESPeRATE as my Dad has high-blood pressure and I knew it worked on the breathing pattern. ---  --- Morgane immediately understood how to use the device, it was so easy and even fun for her. It relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines. Her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far, she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months. She used to have them every two months. ---  --- I have purchased another device for my best friend, a long time migraine sufferer. The way I see it, it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing	pos

If you are new to SD memory, always get more storage than you need because eventually you'll buy something that will use one (camera, handhelds, cell phones, etc. -- note that many cell phones use a smaller "MiniSD")	pos
It is true that this product smells absolutely awful after it is applied to the face. Worse, it does absolutely nothing. I have been applying a significant amount morning and night, for 6 weeks, allowing it to soak in and dry... It does nothing	neg
Millionaire Fredrick Loren played by a young Vincent Price invites five strangers to a party in the House On Haunted Hill. With his delectable wife Annabel in tow, he has set the strangers a task of sorts, if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them $10,000 each, however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer, the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted. ---  --- One of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing. ---  --- At midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next, and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the House on Haunted Hill takes on a life of its own, but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun. ---  --- I enjoyed this film, it wasn't overly suspenseful, but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then, the special effects were none-existent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character Norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house. ---  --- All in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same. --- 	pos

I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen. ---   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.   ---  --- I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much "pop", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about "different", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.   ---  --- Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called "keyboard solo" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.   ---  --- I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.   ---  --- Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from "good" to "great".   ---  --- Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)	neg
This product is simple to use and does a good job converting my home VHS tapes onto DVD.

I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews.  I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding.  He has always had a terrible time with handwriting.  I knew I needed really easy, slow-paced typing instruction for him, or he wouldn't get it. ---  --- Well, it's 6 months later and he can now type!  We did it with nothing but this software.  I made him practice about 10 min/day 5 - 7 days/week.  All in all, he found it to be work to learn this new skill, but still rather enjoyable. ---  --- There are 11 games included and several of them are very good -- meaning they are really fun AND build typing skills at the same time.  There is also a series of drills, lessons, and typing tests to teach the keyboard.  The keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time, and then you repeat the related drills, lessons, tests, and games until those keys are learned fairly well.  I had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section.  This is what the software recommends, but I had to learn it the hard way.  At first, I let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed.  I ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section. ---  --- I would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11.  The cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that.  However, for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons, this would be an excellent way to learn to type too.  I found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software. --- 	pos
I wanted to make sure people who look at this product have a full understanding that Adobe Audition 2.0 WILL NOT install on a Windows 2000 Pro or Server operating system. Almost EVERY reference I have seen regarding OS requirements say Windows but not specifically Windows XP. The only exceptions have been on the Audition box itself and this Amazon listing (go Amazon). So if you are a Windows 2000 user understand that you will need XP for this product. If you can find a copy of Audition 1.5 you're good to go. ---  --- I would say more about the product if I could actually get it installed but with the 12 PCs I use not a one has XP so I have a $300+ book end until I can upgrade (if you can call it that) to XP	neg
Clinton's old friend and key Russia advisor provides insight on a number foreign policy topics as they evolve. As deputy secretary of state, his accounts provide personal, scholarly and practical accounts. The reader might determine both that Talbott was an invaluable resource as the post-Cold War era evolved, and that in the end, Clinton was his own "Russia Hand." ---   ---  The primary theme of the book is the relationship between Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. As they address issues such as NATO expansion, the Balkans, economic difficulties, and each president's own personal troubles, a number of lessons emerge. First, great power politics takes place between human beings, not merely among structural or organizational frameworks. Second, the blending of idealism and realism is thorough and complex, they are not either-or options. Third, political, military, economic, domestic and international issues all impact each other, often in surprising ways. Fourth, watch out for the u in trying to explain policy making: in the generic Y=Ax+By+Cz+u, that u (for unexplained/unexpected) can often play a large role.  ---   ---  The Russia Hand is valuable to students of foreign policy, Russia and U.S.-Russia relations, and the emergence of the post-Cold War era.  --- 	pos

I subscribed to WS for a couple years in the late 90s, and loved the magazine. It keeps a balance between reviews of wines both new (which is the main emphasis) and older vintages, and background stories on vintners and so on. The writers are almost all very good (and I'm a professional writer myself) -- only one of them do I dislike and he doesn't review the wines. Both the wine connoisseur and the novice can profit from reading this publication. I only dropped the subscription because I moved and the collection, no issue of which I wished to discard, was occupying more and more space on my bookshelves.  ---  --- Now I subscribe to the online edition so I can check ratings before I buy a wine. The WS, in addition to Parker and other reviewers, perform an essential service for critical consumers who can't otherwise judge whether a bottle is worth the price asked. And we need WS and Parker and all to tell us when the best reds are ready to drink -- some really great ones are not mature for more than a decade. I drank the highly rated Chateau Canon 1982, for which I'd paid over $100, 17 years after harvest, and my group could tell it wasn't ready -- still closed down. Sure enough, if I had read Spectator carefully, I'd have picked another bottle for that occasion because they said it wasn't yet mature. ---  --- Robert Parker has the reputation for being more influential for high-end wines, but Wine Spectator's scores are generally pretty close to his. And they review a broader spectrum, as noted by other commentators below. WS will often steer you to excellent buys for under $15, or even under $10. If you get only one of these per month, or steers you away from a very overpriced bottle, the subscription (about $50) pays for itself	pos

I visit England frequently.  I have an earlier edition of this book which I find to be very useful, even now.  The new version leaves out a lot of the good places that were in the old book and it lacks credibility.

I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received	pos
It took two people to write this book? I was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. You can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. It was the writing. The main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-I-clever with my snappy dialog way. Nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). Real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. By the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. I won't bother with it	neg
As a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music I was wary of a CD claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid. I need not have worried - Tim O'Brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys I've followed for some time. Not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs, are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions. There are superb performances all round, vocally from O'Brien with guests Paul Brady, Maura O'Connell, Kathhy Mattea, Del McCoury etc and musicians Altan, Frankie Gavin, Jerry Douglas, Earl Scruggs, Seamus Egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh, acoustic and vital, requiring no production gimmicks or effects. Standout songs for me personally are "Mountaineer is Always Free", "Lost Little Children", "Wandering" and "John Riley" although there is not a weak track on the CD. It is obvious that for Tim O'Brien this has been a labour of love. If you like acoustic music, from any tradition, either side of the Atlantic, you'll love it. Several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant	pos
With season 4 the series starts to slide a little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours! That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't too big a let down. For those who are interested the DVD set has great transfers, but few interesting extras	pos

I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received.  However, it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old.  My son was born 5 lb. 11 oz.  He did not fit snugly into this seat, even with the head cushion.  His head rolled around or rolled forward.  I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work.  Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually "fit" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.   	neg
The watch was shipped in a timely manner, actually I receive the watch a few days sooner than the expected delivery date. I purchased this product as a gift for my son.

I do agree with a previous review stating that this watch is not for a small frame man. Although, this is not a problem for me because my son likes the larger watches, I took it to have it resized for him and it fits perfect	pos

I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it. ---  --- I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.  ---  --- I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.  ---  --- Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.  ---  --- Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.  ---  --- He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams. ---  --- "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.  ---  --- When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.  ---  --- Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance.	neg
This is my second set of Garmin radios.  I have had the 120's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530's. ---  --- First of all I really like the new color screen and the added features.  The altimeter has been upgraded over the 120's and seems to be more accurate.  My old 120's sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes.  I would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models.  We do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied. Especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top. ---  --- The new compass is also helpful.  With the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right.  After calibrating the new compass (turning in a circle) it will work just like a regular compass.  I still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup, but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down.  You can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go. The 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can't see your next way point. ---  --- As with all the Rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side.  I really think it's because of the waterproofing that they do.  If you don't put it close to your mouth when speaking it's really not that bad.  I did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications. ---  --- Lock up problem.  I have experienced this once or twice the first time I used them.  I did the Garmin update and have not had the problem since. ---  --- Overall these new 530's are GREAT.  I have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week.  Now that I have 4 of these (2 120's and 2 530's) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group.  Looking forward to the ski slopes this winter.  We always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours. ---  --- If you do a lot of outdoor activities or any Geocaching with more than one person these are perfect!! ---  --- [...] ---  --- 	pos
Ok, so this is probably not the best protection for your iPod, but what do you want for 6 bucks? I'm cheap. If you're not, buy something more expensive perhaps... ---  --- Pros: --- - It does protect the screen and click wheel nicely. --- - The flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely, which I guess helps if you happen to drop it. ---  --- Cons: --- - The belt clip is ridiculous. It's not a stationary clip. Instead it spins around, which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. This product is not for the joggers. --- - The leather strap that comes with it is too short, which makes it difficult to operate the iPod when it's around your neck. --- - It seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under Pros above. But, as long as you never take your iPod out of the case, no worries. --- - This is made for the 30 GB iPod Video, but it's actually a little big for it. It leaves room for the iPod to slide up and down in the case. It makes accessing the HOLD switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down. It's easier to just open the top. ---  --- If you don't care about the cons and you are cheap like me, go ahead and buy it	neg

 I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VM's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable. ---   Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment.My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset.After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they weren't going to do anything to help. ---   ---      I was offered a replacement slider at $20.Obviously I didn't want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610.By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN (when i called to activate the phone)they have the nerve to tell me that I could've purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $24.99 because the slider died.The f!@%ng idiots!HELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONER???and after i spent $50 + tax.sheesh! ---  ---   Anyway back to the phone review..the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here.Its so low that if its in my purse i can't even hear it! WTF??? Also the battery life sucks, no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half.It also doesnt get good service with the VM/Sprint network, my slider had xcellent service w/it despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls. ---     ---    So I've had it 5 days and I'm considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from.However i don't want to buy an expensive phone from VM because I'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them. ---   The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell + they are expensive.I am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise.Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customer but not anymore.  	neg

My four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother.  He already had pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets.  Well, set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as he began to play with it, pieces fell apart.  NOTE:  he is NOT a careless child, nor is he rough with toys.  But this toy doesn't stand up to even the most basic four year old play.   ---   ---  --- After he had had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just boxed it.  We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale.  I just hope those people don't come back to reclaim their money.

I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments.  I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, "just like him".  So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool	pos

I bought the Lotion #2 and the Moisurizing Gel about 3 weeks ago [which is wonderful], but passed on the soap. I'm a teenager who has a slight problem with acne, so that's why I bought the Neutrogena Acne Wash instead, which has salicylic acid that will help for acne.  --- By itself, the acne wash does not work, but so far with the Clinique, I have not broken out at all! Not a single pimple. Everything is smooth and toned. I love my skin and it GLOWS. --- I recommend getting the milder lotion for people with fairer and more sensitive skin, as this is known to peel and cause redness to some. --- The salicylic acid is necessary for me and my light breaks-out-during-THAT-time-of-month skin. So if you do not have an acne problem, I think any soap is alright.  ---  --- To anyone who is worried about spending too much money: --- If it does not work for you, there is a guarantee that lets ou get all your money back.

This 23" LCD HDTV has excellent image quality and looks really stylish, too.  It also comes with HDMI so you can hook up the latest HD video source such as HD-DVD or Blue-ray hi-def DVD players.  The LCD panel itself displays vivid, evenly-lit images, and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model. ---  --- I personally ended up opting for the Sharp LD-23SH1U HDTV LCD monitor because the Sharp works as PC/Mac monitor (plus J&R started offering a $[...]rebate).  But I think this Panasonic is a great choice, too, no doubt about that	pos

 This is without a doubt the best [...] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son, but it isn't a toy. It's a highly functional, albeit inexpensive, metal detector. We've had it now for 3 years and take it camping, etc. --- It will easily find something as small as a rusty staple, and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down, very good if you consider how small the detection coil is. When camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes, rusty nails, and the occasional coin. --- Adjusting the sensitivity is trivial, just hold it away from any metal, and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector LED just goes out. Other reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily, which happened on ours, but a little duct tape goes a long way and this shouldn't stop you from buying one. --- If you get one, make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find. --- PS It also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls	pos
The "Love at First Sip" pods brew a very good (but small) cup of coffee in the Melita one-cup coffee maker. The directions say that you can use the pod for two cycles (which would fill a large mug) but that is only if you enjoy your coffee very weak. This pod and system is perfect for people who only drink 1-2 cups a day and hate the waste and inconsistancy of a self-measuring system	pos
This is a really nice compact camera from Canon. The picture quality is excellent. I have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great. The zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for. The build quality is excellent and I really love the 3" display. I find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it. The camera is very compact but I never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand. The images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp. I would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original Canon battery and its available on Amazon. The accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original Canon parts especially the extra battery. Also get a SD card with large enough memory. What comes with the camera (32MB) is really a waste. Still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card. But overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results	pos
I ordered these earrings thinking they'd be as round as the picture seems to imply.  They're really nice but honestly, they're not as round as they look in the image, which I found a tad disappointing at first.  They're not totally flat or anything like that but the drops look a bit "flatter" in person than they do in the picture.  I'm not blaming Amazon or Silver Insanity for it since they've done nothing wrong.  Products can look different in pictures than in person due to things like light and camera angles.  I just want to give notice to people who buy these earrings.  And yes, they are a substantial piece of jewelry as the previous reviews imply, but not so big that they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy.  They're very nice. 	pos

This Amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series, the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny.

This movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list. ---  --- Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  I figured there would be a little more real suspense or "thrill" but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events.  The biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between Eastwood and Russo. It was contrived, lame, and almost laughable. I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasnt having a nightmare! ---  --- John Malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role.  Unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves.  Clint Eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self. No problem here though, Clint was solid. ---  --- The film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end.  The climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although I saw it coming a mile away.  There was not as much suspense as I was hoping for and the "thrill" was mostly missing. ---  --- What else can I say, watch it and make your own decision but overall I was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews	neg
Did not do what it says it does.  Only thing this does is remove large scratches.  No matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still.  Plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears.  Not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Wait no you don't.  All I got was a jewel case, two pads, and two tiny packets of solution.  What a rip off.  Didn't even get a manual.  What kind of advertisement is this?  I know, the black market kind	neg

This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I've owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first "wet" shaver I've used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use.  ---  --- Note that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value here. Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things. Highly recommended. 	pos

Hacker's Challenge 2 is a sort of practical exam for the Hacking Exposed series. Hacker's Challenge was a terrific book for putting some incident response and forensic skills to use and practicing for the real thing. Hacker's Challenge 2 continues the tradition and should be a must read for anyone who works with network security and incident response. The style of the challenges is fairly entertaining and the plots are so engaging you may not want to put the book down. Its like a best-selling mystery novel for network security techies. It may not affect the quality of the book overall, but I preferred having the authors of the individual challenges identified as they were in Hacker's Challenge. However, you should definitely buy this book!  ---  --- (...	pos
I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. The first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is.  This is a slider phone, and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message.  ---  --- Next, we go to the features.  So we got a 1.3MP camera, camcorder, music player, 1GB microSD card, bluetooth support, and infrared port..and *drumroll please* an FM radio.  Now, the FM radio isn't satellite based, so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U.S., just those stations local to you. ---  --- Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature: ---  --- 1.  Camera - Impressive picture quality. Yes it's only 1.3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras, but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does? 5/5 ---  --- 2.  Camcorder - Not all that impressive.  While you are recording, the quality seems perfect.  However, once you play it, it turns a bit distorted.  Plus, it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card. 3/5 ---  --- 3.  Music Player - Impressive.  The speaker is of good quality, and very loud.  However, I still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist.  There's play, pause, next song, previous song, fast forward, and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures. The buttons must be pressed fairly hard, so your music won't start playing spontaneously in your pocket. Also, I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds. 4/5 ---  --- 4. FM Radio - I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement.  Well, the truth is you don't need to buy anything extra.  Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone, and this will serve as an 'antenna' and will allow you to hear stations. And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio, yes the sound will go to the earbuds. However, there's a 'loudspeaker' option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker, but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in, as it serves as the 'antenna'.  This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone, you NEED to have the earbuds with you. You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna (or you may have to move) in order to get clear reception. 3/5 ---  --- Misc. Info: ---  --- Only two games to included, and both trials. (Lumines, Texas Hold'em) ---  --- You can't transfer games from another phone. You must pay and download them again. ---  --- You can't delete the pre-created profiles (those that come with the phone). You can just create your own. ---  --- In order to change the phone to vibrate, you must make a vibrating profile. Then to use it, it takes several steps, which is not hard, but inconvenient.   ---  --- The interface shows the month and date, but not the day of the week. ---  --- Only two face templates included with the phone. ---  --- That's all for now. ---  --- Overall: 4/	pos

I've been using metal detectors for around 5 years now. My first detector was a Bounty Hunter QuickDraw II, a very fine, easy to learn detector that's a real workhorse. I learned most everything I know about metal detecting from personal experience and from reading lots of posts and asking lots of questions at the Bounty Hunter Forum http://www.detecting.com  ---  --- I shopped around and found the Bounty Hunter Land Ranger as a factory shipped model (no extras except 4" and 8" coil) for $337. For that price, I couldn't afford not to buy it!  ---  --- When the Land Ranger (LR) arrived, it was in 3 pieces and extremely easy to assemble. The manual that comes with the LR gives you the basic information you need to get started detecting with the LR, but is a bit general when it comes to explaining what each of the functions do.  ---  --- If you just want a "Turn On and Go" detector, the Land Ranger may not be for you. If this is the case, I would recommend getting an easier to learn detector such as the Bounty Hunter QuickDraw II or even the Bounty Hunter Tracker IV. Should you later decide to get the Land Ranger, your first detector will make an excellent back-up detector and a great detector for a friend or family to use with you. What I would recommend is going to the Bounty Hunter Forum website listed above to learn, way more, information about various detectors and their various functions than I could ever begin to explain here.  ---  --- Even though I had been detecting for a while, my first trip out with the Land Ranger was quite overwhelming and somewhat frustrating due to the much greater sensitivity of this model, the added features it has and an the information overload of tones responding to mineralized ground conditions, trashy areas (many pulltabs, screwcaps etc.) and a condition know as "falsing" (tones due mostly to incorrect "Sensitivity" settings and improper Ground Balancing). The initial experience that I describe here is very common with first time Land Ranger users and is frustrating, but will get much better with practice and with the more one learns about detecting in general and about the Land Ranger in particular.  ---  --- As I use the Land Ranger now, I have learned much about settings, what to ignore and what to watch for to indicate which targets may be worth digging. Once past the information overload (that will happen, I assure you), the user will begin to appreciate the sensitivity of this detector, learn the proper settings, begin finding more and more valuable items (or targets as they are called) and become one with this detector.  ---  --- I purchased the Bounty Hunter Land Ranger for it's very sophisticated microprocessor features including - Target Id, VDI (numeric) readout indicating target conductivity, 3 Tone ID, it's automatic & manual Ground Balancing, Programmable Target Accept/ Reject, All Metals, No Motion/ Pinpoint mode, Self Tuning (Motion) All Metals Mode (good for deep hunting of Relics, Caches and/or gold nugget shooting) ... And ... for the reputation of Bounty Hunter Detectors ... but MAINLY for the excellent price of such a full featured, professional metal detector.  ---  --- I love being able to put this baby to work discriminating out trash items while ringing in sharp and clear when locating coins and jewelry. The Land Ranger is also ideal for hunting Relics and for (gold) nugget shooting, although I have not done much of either of these yet (soon, I hope). I also love the fact that two coils (standard 8" and 4" nugget coil) come stock with the Land Ranger and I also have a 10" coil that I purchased for around $60. (it's important to have several coil sizes available for various types of hunting) The price of additional coils for many other brands of detectors is astronomical, so this was an integral part of my decision to get a Bounty Hunter rather than some other brands.  --- I love how lightweight this detector is. I love knowing that I have a sophisticated detector that will not miss items that are buried deep. (how deep depends on the size of object, type of metal, soil conditions etc) Generally, the LR will detect to a depth of around 10"-12" deep for a coin sized target. (believe me, you won't want to dig too many objects THAT deep, most targets are right around 4"-6" deep, due to how coins, jewelry etc. tend to migrate down into the soil, this varies, of course, but in general, a greater number of objects are somewhere in this depth range.  ---  --- What I hate about the Land Ranger is that parts of the manual give a very general description of certain features like the ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode. I wish that the Land Ranger were waterproof or at least water resistant ...  --- it is not, and I highly recommend that you do not use it in the rain without a good plastic cover that fits securely around the control housing.  ---  --- In Conclusion:  ---  --- I highly recommend the Land Ranger for any seasoned detectorist ... or for a novice detectorist that is willing to devote a good deal of time and a fair amount of patience to mastering the many nuances of this full featured detector. The Land Ranger hosts Target ID, (VDI) Numeric Readout, 3 Tone ID, Depth Meter, Battery Meter, Ground Monitor Meter, Sensitivity meter and Target indicator. It has Touchpad controls for Sensitivity, Accept/ Reject Discrimination, All Metals - No Motion/ Pinpoint mode, 3 Factory Preset modes, All Metals (Motion) Self Tuning mode and for Smart Trac Automatic and Manual Ground Balancing.  ---  --- It's a handful, but a great full featured unit for a very reasonable price. 5 stars ... Highly Recommended if you are willing to devote some time and patience in learning it's traits and harnessing it's potential, once you do, you'll absolutely love it, I know I do!  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- Recommended --- Yes	pos
 --- "The Economist" is a great weekly magazine with in-depth, balanced and enlightening journalism. The articles are largely expertly written by knowledgeable people. ---  --- The writing in "The Economist" is interesting and insightful with articles conveying detailed and yet condensed information. The magazine has contributions from senior people from all over the world, making it interesting and relevant to a worldwide readership. ---  --- The editors and journalists of the Economist need to be applauded for the broad range of well-written articles with balanced analysis every week. Reading this magazine ensures that I know what is happening worldwide every week, although I do not always agree with some positions the magazine takes. ---  --- This is recommended reading for business leaders and decision makers who require a diverse range of views and information about what is happening at different places in the world on subjects as diverse as politics, current affairs, science and technology, national, regional and global issues, finance, trade, and development. Even Great People like Nelson Mandela relied on this magazine for news during his long years in prison.	pos
If you're intimidated by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky's long masterpieces, consider starting instead with Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons."  This book is of course a masterpiece of Russian literature.

When you're done here, try "War and Peace" or at least "Crime and Punishment.	pos
The review below by "Owen Wilson" is pretty funny.  He never took it out of the box, and it stopped running, so he returned it.  LOL!  It's an automatic watch, dude!  You have to wear it to wind it, or it stops. ---  --- ANYways, I've had mine for about 4 months now and barely ever take it off.  It keeps excellent time, gaining only a second or two a day.  I really like having this wonderful piece of classic technology on my wrist, I like the size and substantial weight of it, and it's very comfortable to wear. ---  --- I took a star off the rating because the original strap developed an unpleasant odor after a couple of weeks, which no amount of scrubbing would remove.  I replaced it with an after-market Italian rubber strap.  3 months later the new strap still smells pleasantly of vanilla, which I guess is a common additive in real rubber straps.  Who knew?  The original strap looked a bit beefier and more diver-like, but the new strap has a deployment clasp which is handy. ---  --- Occasionally I wish I had bought the SKX007 instead, as I like the look of the round markers, but it hasn't bothered me much that these are square, and I prefer the second hand on this watch.  I really like the way SAT is blue and SUN is red - reminds me it's the weekend. ---  --- This is my first modern automatic and overall I'm very happy with my purchase.	pos
I bought the grill for father's day and found it a great purchase. I've been thinking about getting a new grill, but forking over hundreds of dollars for a standup felt a bit much. Even though the price of the go-anywhere grill is cheap, it is pretty solid. I've only used it once so far, but it works nicely. I can fit 4 ears of corn on the grill, 16 chicken wings or 6 teriyaki beef skewers. It took a few minutes to assemble the grill and is brain dead simple. the best part is the portability. I used it for the first time today and as the meat was starting to cook, it started to rain. Thanks to the unpredictable NorthEast weather. Since the grill is portable, I picked it up and moved to the garage. Try that with a standup grill. ---  --- I would gladly recomment the grill to friends and famil	pos

I got this to go with my new Silver B Weber and I had the best chicken and ribs that I've had in a very, very long time. It is extremely simple to assemble, operate and most importantly, to clean.

The small parts get clean by simply placing in hot,soapy water in the sink. I plan on using this a lot.	pos
BUYER BEWARE!!!! --- I recently ordered (December 15th, 2007) this product through Amazon filled by Joe Brands for my son for Christmas.  On Amazon's website it says you can cancel an order any time before it ships, if it does ship, you simply refuse receipt.  I canceled this order on December 16th less than 24 hours after I placed it, I called and emailed Joe Brands & emailed Amazon. Never the less the package arrives on December 22nd.  I called the shipping company, called and emailed Joe Brands, emailed Amazon and the package was finally picked up on the 27th of December.  The billing however has yet to be straighted out.

The Rion Mini Lean-To greenhouse comes in a flimsy cardboard box that contains about a hundred plastic parts. It difficult to put together because the parts are poorly labeled. (Making it even more difficult for me was that several parts were missing.) The 12 page instruction manual shows several diagrams - but no photos - with parts labelled to help with assembly. One classic exerpt on page 7, "The 'OUT' on the 2D connector should face the inside of the Mini Lean-To". This kind of product gives the term "some assembly required" a bad name.  ---  --- Also, it's a bit pricely to be so flimsy and poorly designed. Save yourself the trouble get something else.  ---  ---  --- 	neg
After using TurboTax couple of years and then using TaxCut for last two years (2005 and 2006 returns) I concluded that TurboTax is much superior software. TaxCut's only advantage is that it is cheaper. If you take out price from the equation, TaxCut is inferior in quality. ---  --- - In 2005 TaxCut software there was not PDF output of all the forms. This was pretty silly because after couple of years if I want to access my tax return I am not going to install TaxCut again in my computer and view by return. I would rather have have my tax return available in some widely acceptable format like PDF and then access/distribute whenever I want (I don't keep my documents in hardcopies). So I wrote to H&R Block. This year they added that saving return in PDF file feature available. But unfortunately, this is far from being perfect. It excludes number of important forms - example, IRS form 8853, California Adjustment Schedule 540CA etc. Instead of that it saves numbers of useless worksheet (without any data entered in those worksheets), same form multiple times. ---  --- - Most annoying thing about this software is updating incorrect data. In one form I entered wrong data. While reviewing it I found a problem and went to that specific section to update. But in calculation TaxCut still showed old incorrect number. I just could not make it to use new corrected number. Eventually I had to restart a new return from scratch - just to have an dollar amount corrected. ---  --- - In many section useful Helps are missing	neg
The computer that I bought June 2006 came with Nero 6 OEM version.  It has worked very well.  I finally got around to clicking on the upgrade icon and ordered what I thought would be a serial number to unlock some features.  It turns out that is not available, and I have bought the Nero 7 Ultra version, which required a 195 MB download. Having dialup, I was not pleased.  I asked for my money back.  No response.  I faxed BBB complaint with copies to Nero offices in California and Germany. The office in Germany responded with email that they do not do refunds. Los Angeles BBB has been unresponsive.  --- I finally got the download from a computer with broadband. I uninstalled Nero 6 and set restore point.  I installed Nero 7.  It worked!  But it was agonizingly slow.  I don't mean the CD or DVD writing per se was slow. When I eventually got it going that gave me the full speed of my hardware. However navigating from each click to response felt like it was in a 486 and not an Athlon 64.  I think other programs were also rendered more sluggish in opening files. --- I uninstalled Nero 7, and just to be safe I then used restore point from before I installed it. I reinstalled Nero 6. What a relief!  There may be some fancy features Nero 6 OEM lacks, but it's worth it to have the computer working at reasonable speed. If I want to rip a music track to a .wav file (a feature lacking in the OEM version), it's easier to reboot to linux and run K3b than put up with sluggish Nero 7 Ultra to do it. ---  --- A product and company gone bad; Nero 7 is definitely not recommended	neg
O.k,these glosses are just plain yummy! ---  --- Actually,they don't taste like lipglosses at all,which is a good thing.No one wants waxy or  --- chemical flavored gloss that  --- makes you want to throw up,right? ---  --- All the flavors are amazingly delicious.Each one tastes just like sweets. ---  --- The colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky. ---  --- They go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle. ---  --- I wish the  tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky. ---  --- Overall,nice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes	pos
The story of "Alice in Wonderland" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos. ---  --- Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent. --- Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled "drink me" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door. ---  --- Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing "Alice in Wonderland" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world. ---  --- Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869. ---  --- I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney. ---  --- For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches "Fantasia" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey. ---  --- This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!	pos

My first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking.  Then I tried to use it.  I mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer.  In the first day of use I just ran out of patience and plan to return it. ---  --- Here's the problems I had with the Altitech2 ---  --- 1. Most of the time the buttons work fine, but several times I pressed the mode button and the mode did not change. ---  --- 2. When setting Declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press SET/RESET/LIGHT to reverse the digits, but as soon as you press the SET/RESET/LIGHT button the unit ends the calibration mode. ---  --- 3. The temperature was stuck at 87.5 degrees for about an hour after purchase.  Finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81.5 degrees.  I held the unit in front of the AC vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees, I suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees.  The temperature display never budged from 81.5 degrees. ---  --- 4. I constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the Altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber.  The digital thermometer registered 78 degrees, the Altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees.  I blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer.  The digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and I turned the heat off.  The Altitech2 stayed at exactly 81.4 degrees.  After removing from the chamber the Altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees, went down to 92.6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes.  Despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees. ---  --- 5. The compass will only stay on for 10 seconds, then the display turns off to conserve battery.  This never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map.  When the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display.  Since this button is recessed, you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail (I had to).  This moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button.  I'll stick with my 19th century compass for now. ---  --- This unit might be worth keeping for me if the Altimeter is reliable, but after all the other trouble I had I did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as I had lost confidence in the device. --- 	neg
Brando can sing!! --- Guys and Dolls is proof. One of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955, has Brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by THE VOICE - Sinatra. Now only a mad man will say that Brando is a better singer than Sinatra, but to give Brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad man will say Sinatra is a better actor than Brando. ---  --- Guys and Dolls is a very important film in Brando's career. It is the first light hearted movie he made. All his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff. This is the first movie where Brando is having fun and what fun it was. ---  --- Great songs, great acting and great stars...GUYS and DOLLS is 4 star entertainment all the way. ---  --- Brando and Simmons along with Sinatra and Blaine are amazing. 	pos

This is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but doesn't understand him/her.   --- I was expecting some new information about a "secret language".  There was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the "secret"? --- I agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip.  The author says that cats do not get lonely.  Well, that's wrong.  He also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served.  How does one explain cats who live with homeless street people?   --- The title was deceiving	neg

The repeller works fine at repelling, but when on the "rodent" setting it makes an audible chirping noise that's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people don't normally go. ---  --- The reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed, but the manual says that it'll only run two or three days on battery power, making it absolutely worthless for this use	neg
Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware.  ---  --- Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software. ---  --- 	neg

Don't buy this watch, unless you want it (and your good taste) to be admired.  It's just beautiful, sort of like man-jewelry for guys that don't wear jewelry. ---  --- But I plan to wear it only when I wear certain clothing, to certain events.    I have other watches for other situations	pos

I have been using this product now for almost a year. The only reason I insist using it is because I feel really bad for wasting my money. First, this is not worth $300 bucks. --- There are only still pictures and sound. No movies or any fancy graphics, so why the price? Second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences. Third, the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all. You keep memorizing thins like "the boy is under the airplane" or "the ball is on the boy's head". --- Initially I thought, well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad. But then I took a look at the last lessons; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue.  --- I cannot recommend you another course because I spent so much in this one that I do not want to try again and get disappointed. Don't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like I was. This is definitively NOT worth 300 dollars. It is not even useful for basic converstion. I have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library. --- Ah, and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar ..	neg
Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills	neg
I've used the Pigeon brand (I believe it's from Japan) milk storage bags- those are the best-quality bags I've ever used. Unfortunately, they're also very difficult to find.

A quality photography book that visually recounts pertinent steps in the history of noir photography and more specifically, the creation of the term noir as it pertains to film and photography in the 20th c. in New York  City.  A breath of realism, history and fact that beautifully illustrates a  fine curatorial example of the kinds of images published by the Daily News  that made this paper a forerunner in the telling of real stories suffered  and celebrated by real people.  William Hannigan is to be commended for his  fine selection of photographic and negative samples of a time not long past  and still very alive in the movies and crime documents that inspire and  fascinate us today.  A necessary addition to any photo library of value	pos

I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it.  The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at.  The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags.  This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards.  There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot.   ---  --- The correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens.  Given that limitation, this is a great bag. ---  --- The bag is very well made and holds my Canon Powershot S2 IS very securely.  I lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if I accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly.  The material is great and the waist belt is very practical.  The strap is well padded and after a day of use I believe it is one of the most comfortable straps I have used.   ---  --- Buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it.   	pos

I agree w/ everything "Anon Y. Mouse" said about this candy! SOO good. So different. It tastes European in that it doesn't overload you with sugar. They are almost delicate and creamy while being slightly (slightly) fruit flavored! It is a nice change from American candy. I found these at a local coffee shop, and will definitely be purchasing them again! ---  --- I think I have overlooked Haribo for some reason, but this product is really good. Haribo is based from Germany, but sold in the US too.. ---  --- Pico Balla is a unique candy, and they are small, so you don't have to commit to eating a king sized piece of candy :) Try these, they are very interesting	pos
I am a huge fan of BBC period drama and have nearly exhausted my library's supply of miniseries based on the works of Austen, Gaskell, Dickens, and Eliot. But I would have to say that the BBC struck out this time. The direction was bad, the acting was mediocre at best, the music was obtrustive, and the screenplay was just plain awful. After the first half-hour my sisters and I survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another. I have not read the book so I don't know how much of it is from the source material. Makes me curious to read it, though. The costumes and some of the scenery were good; I'll give it that	neg
I received a very well packaged (and promptly shipped even) package of the Habanero Jerky from Mahogany Smoked Meats. ---   ---  The jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from Oberto or whomever). The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar. ---   ---  However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well. ---   ---  As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some "slightly spicy" product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way. ---   ---  The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway. ---   ---  Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product. ---   ---  I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves. ---   ---  Definitely recommended	pos

**** --- Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each: --- AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter --- CALM:  nice chamomile tea --- CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine --- CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no "natural flavorings" --- DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine --- EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience  --- LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's --- PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious --- WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps --- ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea ---  --- Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers.  ---  --- Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing. ---  --- Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.  --- ***	pos
I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. --- The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be	neg

As a student of urban development and politics, I can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind. Davis offers a hardline Marxist view of Los Angeles that, by employing simply economic analysis, does not allow for the intricacies of the city's problems. Class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of Los Angeles -- anyone outside of the ISO should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel	neg
If you're looking to hear Robert Johnson's songs, you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible.  As this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years, I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs, and talk about his life... that's all we have now.  And of course the covers do not outdo him; that would be impossible.  But there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of Robert Johnson and the world he lived in.  The discussion with a former classmate is touching, and the covers of his songs by those who knew him (Robert Lockwood Jr., Honeyboy Edwards)and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as Guy Davis, Roy Rogers and especially Alvin Youngblood Heart blew me away.  Gov't Mule and Sonny Landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work.  The major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n' roll hall of fame gathering, and also Bob Weir's performance, which is just plain bad.  All in all, it is a good film, and it's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music, as we will never be able to see the real thing	pos
Big plus was the large digits on display: I'm short-sighted and run without my specs, so I needed that. The feel of the watch is nice.

Bigger problem yet: it took all of about 4 months for the plastic strap to break	neg
Ted is a lonely bellhop. He's got the whole hotel all to himself on New Year's eve. So, what else can he do but be the lap dog for every requesting customer. But, he only has to worry about four particular, and sometimes peculiar, rooms. Each room is a story involving ted, directed by four different directors. Call it a collaboration of different comedic talents. So, let's go through them, one by one. ---  --- Story one: The Secret ingriediant --- Not really much to go on here. A coven of witches are trying to ressurect some virgin wicth who was wrongly accused of a crime. Not really that funny. It's a bumpy start but it gets better. ted stays the same goofy self all through the movie. ---  --- Story Two: the wrong man. --- A mistaken identity sex game in which ted accidently found himself in. Constantly he tries to escape the room. Funnier than the last one. Still bumpy, though. ---  --- Story Three: The Misbehavers (Directed by Robert Rodriguez) --- Funny story of a couple leaving their kids in the room to go celabrating the new years eve at a party. These kids are bad news. They get their hands into any and everything. Poor ted runs rampant to make sure they won't misbehave or else the father will kill him. ted at his best here. hilarity incarnate. Explosively funny. ---  --- Story four: The Bet (Directed by Quentin Tarantino.) --- An after hours new years eve party with a witty group of filmakers who have had too much to drink. Quentin stars. Bruce willis too. Ted stays the same, quirky and naive as well. Funny and different, but quick on the jokes. There is one take where there is just one uncut shot, lasting well over ten minutes. They must've rehearsed that one for hours. ---  --- the overall feel of the movie is unique and full of laughs. ---  --- Enjoy	pos
This is one of the most fun games I've every played.  There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question.  I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions.  A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff).   We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs.  Try it, it is loads of fun.  I recommend a group of at least 4 though	pos
My daughter got this for Christmas and it only says, "Know what goes good with everything? Ripped Pants!"  Then he sings, "You won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants." and then says, "This is so embarrassing!"  My daughter dropped the toy once and it said a different phrase but we can't get it to do it again. It seems like it's stuck in the "demo" mode and we can't figure out how to make it work.   ---  --- I called Fisher Price and due to unsually high call volume they disconnect you after telling you to call back another time,  Probably due to the fact that every parent who's child recieved this toy is calling to complain.	neg
Got a very similar model at a Babies R Us several months ago, but without the adult's handle. My son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself, and we generally like the style, but the trike tips so easily that I rarely take it out for him to use. Never would have thought to check this but I'll be in the market for a big-wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model.	neg

as the director and actors of this mess should, on their skinny french knees.  Complete waste of film and your time. Not erotic, sexy (? was that actress really a woman?, was her boyfriend really a man? or visa/versa) Damned if I could tell.  And that old man who tired her up, ya think he had enough rope? The movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through.  French people are not pretty, and this woman was not only NOT pretty, but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma.  Even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog.  Save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience	neg

I have some dry bumpy bits at the top of my arms that have been resistant to any scrubby product I've ever tried to use, but buffy got my skin so smooth! Amazing, and highly recommended. Soak in the tub/shower/whatever so the hot water softens up your skin, then scrub away. The small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses; the large is twice as big. The small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff. ---  --- This thing has lots of great little scrubby bits in it. Ground rice, ground almonds, AND adzuku beans. Not just one, but three, and they are all super-scrubby. You'll be a little red when you're done, but it's SO worth it once you've cooled off and your skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom. ---  --- The only downside is that it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into the bottom of it once the thing drains. The bar melts at around 'hot water' temperature, and you're not supposed to use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't have to! The moisturizing oils in the bar really do work very well. I'll definitely be picking up a couple more of these. ---  --- The cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent is really amazing as well. Soothing AND refreshing, it can wake you up in the morning or calm you down at night before you go to sleep. Definitely try this thing, though, if you're looking for ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing	pos
I was very surprised by the reviews below because I found this magazine absolutely wonderful!! The articles range from architecture, to renovated homes, to specific garden types to the average home owner. I found so many great ideas and inspiration in this magazine as well. The pictures are great and I find myself tearing things out every month! ---  --- Fantastic for anyone interested in design, art, or interior decorating	pos

Bought 2 different monitors; this one has great features such as the motion sensor, auto and scan settings. The night vision is weak but daytime looks great. Better reception than the other video monitor I bought but not having good night vision is a drawback. I really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom. None of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear. It is the best one that I've found on the market	pos
The suspicious side of me wants to believe that HP did a promo with their Deskjet 612C - i.e. they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements.  I would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612C black replacement cartridge C6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660C other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case	neg
We all love George Lucas for creating the Star Wars Universe and introducing us to some of the best characters in movie history but lets face reality here, the man cannot write dialogue to save his life.  In the OT it wasn't as noticeable because the plot was not very complicated and the scenes were very straightforward, the foundation was already there.  The PT has to lay that foundation which George Lucas fails at. ---  --- So ignoring the wooden dialouge which produced stilted acting, it is a great movie nonetheless.  The plot gives the audience an idea how the Empire was created in the first place and gives you a glimpse into the dark side of Anakin and sets the audience up very nicely from his ultimate turn from the good side.  Also for a hopeless romantic such as myself I get to watch a couple fall in love when they're not supposed to and not let rules and regulations stand in their way.  Yes, romance is where GL fails miserably but its the story that counts.  ---  --- Overall, in this movie as in TPM, there is a lot story and symbolism here which makes it stand out.  So my advice is to see the movie, and pay more attention to the story being told.  If nothing else, you'll get to hear some really beautiful music, see some cool special effects and see some cool costumes that you wish you had	pos
I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one. ---  --- For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents: ---  --- TRY THIS ONE IF... --- - You have a very abundant milk supply --- - You only plan to pump one or twice a month --- - You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period ---  --- INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF... --- - You're going back to work --- - Your milk supply is medium to low --- - You plan to pump more than two or three times per month --- - You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency) ---  --- Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)	neg
I purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that I expected, It did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time.

If you have the Philip's Sonicare brand electric toothbrush, don't buy this unit, they do not fit in slots.I had to return mine, and am out shipping, handling, & return shipping charges.

It has some flaws, you will have to run around a bit between play areas, but it plays well enough.  The price is right, and it is worth the time you will spend on it.  The learning curve is small, and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the CD if you look for them (a neat extra).

If you are buying this product because it is the cheapest one Intuit offers, excpect to get what you pay for.  If your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet, or downloading the free version from Microsoft, or even using their home version with business added.  By the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it. ---  --- Bottom line, if you want a good Quickbooks bump up to the Pro version, so you can get real Customer and Vendor management, and a decent overview summary, and multiple category levels	neg
I just purchased the Archos 604 about 3weeks ago. So far so good. It interfaces very easily with the computer. Though I have not tried it using Windows Media 10 yet. I recommend at least buying the Archos Docking Adapter Kit (if you do not plan on using the Archos to record programs). It allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos. ---  --- The only negative that I have so far is that the volume, at its highlest level, is difficult to hear on an airplane. You may need some noise canceling headphones	pos
I received my order today, and discovered (as with all of the Hasa products in my order) that although more than one item is pictured--  only one comes with the order.  The item itself is very small, 2 1/2" X 1".  That, fine, I can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood, lifesize would make play a work-out for most children. However, shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for ONE item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising	neg
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image.  ---  --- Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being shallow and petal shaped, this type of protection is also limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace.  ---  --- This hood is manufactured for the Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS EF and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering.  ---  --- Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens itself isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem.  ---  --- While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood.  Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. ---  --- PROS:  --- Improves contrast and image quality  --- Reduces lens flare problems  --- Offers limited protection to the lens  ---  --- CONS:  --- Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens	pos
We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first.  I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it.  The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in.  As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer.  There should be some way to fix it when it pops out.  Definitely would not reccommend it.  To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept	neg
These strawberries are great.  They are great on cereal.  The price is fantastic.  My kids had some freeze dried berries at a "space center" but they were much more expensive.  These are a steal.  I am so happy to know where to get great freeze dried berries at a great price. 	pos
I agree with another reviewer, whose information I read only after I'd purchased the clean shopper.  It is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap.  I returned this product as soon as I saw the strap, which you need to attach your child to the cart, is separate from the cover.  This was not specified in the description. Also, it just bothered me that the printed material...the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child, not you, for heaven's sake, are printed upside down to their eye.  Sorry, but I have enough to look at when I'm grocery shopping. I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child. The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced. All of the other cart covers I've seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart, and are well designed, start at $60.   	neg
I just received this table, and I can already tell that it will be a great asset for my scrapbooking.  The table is adjustable in height, so no matter where I am scrapbooking, I can adjust the height to fit the chair I am sitting in. The table is light enough for me to move by myself, and will fold up for easy storage.  The table is also sturdy enough to use paper punches and eyelet setters.  I'm thinking of purchasing another, so I can spread out even more!	pos

My niece is happy, so can't complain much about that.	pos
Director:  Denzel Washington --- Cast:  Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant, Salli Richardson, Malcolm David Kelley, Cody Hodges, Leonard Earl Howze, Novella Nelson. --- Running Time:  120 minutes --- Rated PG-13 for violence, language and mature thematic material involving child abuse. ---  --- Based on a true story, and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book, "Antwone Fisher" is at heart a study of psychological disturbance, laced with reasonable amounts of Hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit. It's a peculiarly American medicine, swallowed less willingly in some markets than others, which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused Denzel Washington's directorial talents (which are generally good) with the various workings of his film's plot, which can be argued about.  Antwone Fisher's story starts in the navy, where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate, and is hauled up before the Captain. Sent to navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Washington), he begins to work out issues of anger that, it turns out, stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend. At the same time Fisher (played exceptionally well by newcomer Derek Luke), struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting Cheryl (Joy Bryant). In a parallel plot thread, Washington's character, the ever-reasonable Dr. Davenport, is having marital problems. In due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and Fisher is a catalyst for his own change.  ---  --- Fisher's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route: after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience, he was hired by a Sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable. Most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft, although Washington's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks. The most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character. These include the psychiatrist's ironic domestic problems, as well as Fisher's tentative love life. One is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements, leavening the appeal of a central, harrowing, personal history. The Fisher - Cheryl romance for instance, while in context necessarily clumsy, is also ultimately gauche. And once consummated, it is left to languish without further comment, as if further exploration of this side to Fisher's maturing was unnecessary.  Perhaps sensing this central weakness, Fisher's script introduces another element into the young African-American's tortured life as a foster child. During flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation' justifications from Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting. Significantly, such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself, and soon disappear from view. On the plus side is the central performance by Derek Luke as the hero, a perfectly judged acting job, that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - "I don't know what to do" - with lack of self-pity. Washington's role is also well done. Given the difficulty of the actor-director role, he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss, either in front or behind the camera.  ---  --- This is Washington's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of Antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing, it's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods. Arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of Luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously Washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role. Despite its flaws, "Antwone Fisher" is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged, enigmatic individual; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn't have to endure such horrors.	pos

I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed. --- My recommendation is don't buy this model!!	neg

I wouldn't even give this toy one star if I wasn't forced to.  Mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980's graphics and even worse sound.

Renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer Robert M. Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book, The Buddha Tarot Companion: A Mandala of Cards. This book affords a rich unique perspective of the Tarot through the lens of the Buddhist paradigm. The companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand, a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions, "Embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols." Other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the Buddha cards include: "Smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading." and "Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy, promote healing, or provide protective energy." Also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards. Both items are published by Llewellyn, who as always, have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented. ---  --- Robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the Buddha with the Tarot journey through the cards. He describes how the Major Arcana fits perfectly with the life of Siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment. Each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. In fact, it is Mr. Place's belief that the creators of the Tarot were directly influenced by the life of the Buddha, and incorporated archetypes into the Major Arcana based on his journey. He teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. Instead, "the classical world maintained communications with India and the ancient Western philosophers were familar with Indian philosophies." As well, the Islamic world introduced the Christians to the life of the Buddha during the Middle Ages. "The European Christians were enamored with the story, and they transformed him into a Christian saint - St. Josaphat."  ---  --- I was fascinated by the titles given to the Major Arcana cards. Each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the Siddhartha's personal journey to become the enlightened one, the Buddha. ---  --- Robert Place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice Eastern beliefs. He also acts as a mediator to help people of the Western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of Buddhism and its teachings for life. I highly recommend this deck - I found it very easy to follow, the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to "read" using a Buddhist world view.  --- 	pos
These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them. I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! These hair growth pills are too damn expensive, so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work. The fact that it does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping, with a total of a little over $46, is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing. Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.	neg

I love mysteries set in WW II and like old time radio so I couldn't wait to begin this one. The "hero" is a junior varsity Tom Joad but,OK, I was game.  The cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable "baddies" and "goodies".  They were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and I pushed on. Then when we got to the Jersey shore, I found out that in 1942 with America fighting for it's life against fascism, and losing, our hero knew why.  All the servicemen were bullies (A drafted station employee) or morons (the Coast Guard beach patrol).  The 4F "hero" was the real McCoy however.  Although not actually mentioned I bet he wished that dratted ear injury hadn't kept him from joining the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was moderate enought to think Marxism had some problems; the murder of 10s of millions of Ukrainians and the Nazi-USSR Pact probably and I say probably, didn't elude our observant literary genius.  He was also a 1975 era feminist; all those plucky WW II women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support.  Most big businessmen, probably wearing spats and silk high hats, were the bad guys needless to say.  I wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book.  I couldn't finish it and it's a point of honor for me to finish all books.  Then in the bio it all became clear.  The author was a flack for former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder of Colorado.  I'm still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated, Quaker schoolmarm expression that said "somebody, somewhere is having fun and I want it to stop now!!!"  Anyone who could stand to work for Pat could write this book with ease	neg
I expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called "batteries."  Number one, I was disappointed to find out, after some scientific analyses I performed on them, that duracell's world famous  "copper top" statement is erroneous. This so called "copper  top" is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called  copposyclamatrane. I can't top the copper top? hardly.     After the  analyses, I put these "copper top" batteries to the test.  What I  did was I stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like  sheen.  What I got was far from.  A tiny light that could only be  classified as much less than miniscule.  I threw the flashlight at my cat  in disgust, expecting hilarious results, and I wasn't disapointed!  This  was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision I've  ever made.  Thanks for nothing, dura-hell	neg
I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it	neg
i just wanted to say this is a great workout. i love the eastern dance styles. i have just written a long review of honey's bollywood workout,and people were saying the same things, too fast etc...but indian dance is taught by imitation, and is very expressive facially and bodily(especially the classical dances) and open to improv. bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical. most don't realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating, learning, and memorizing from the beginning. the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so, because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying. so have fun with this, it's awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned. and it really wears you out. plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form! but i find eastern to be the most passionate, feminine, beautiful, and divine. have fun	pos
If any kid music annoys you, this CD is NOT for you.  These are good old classic songs, but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs.  I'm throwing it away.  I want my two-year-old to know the songs I know and love, but this was a bad buy on my part. 	neg
I am very happy with this watch. I really enjoy running and I wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over-exertion and injury. The polar website said heart-rate monitoring helps with pace, getting the desired benefits from my run, and helped to reduce injury. ---  --- Pros: Works perfectly, immediately picked up by the gym equipment--no holding on required, setting 3 zones for warm-up, running, and cool down was a snap, the audible beeps help me to know when I'm slacking off or working too hard, the constant feedback is very motivating. ---  --- Cons: Not many here, however, the screen seems difficult to see in the sunshine. Will have to see the effect of that when spring comes ! ---  --- I did a lot of shopping online and I liked the Polar M-61 ($130) best but I got this one because of the lower price ($80). The M-61 has more features and is more fashionable; so you may want to look at that one too	pos
Its the best table out there. I did a lot of research and now have a year of "testing." We bought it for my daughter when she was 1, and she's almost 3. I also run a daycare.

My first viewing of this film was a great disappointment.  I expected another Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy film, with Chevalier substituting for Eddy.  And I emphatically did not like the film.  Then I viewed the film a second time, this time with the play-by-play voice-over analysis by Miles Kreuger, which comes as a extra bonus on this DVD.  Suddenly I was seeing the film in a completely different light, and absolutely loving this film.  This DVD is an absolute gem, and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by Miles Kreuger, not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s.  It is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life, as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming (because he's talked to those who were).

I registered for this kit and got two - at first I considered taking one back, but I am glad I didn't.  It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any! ---  --- I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom.  The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests.   ---  --- The vapor bath is fantastic.  We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion! ---  --- I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice.  We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn.  ---  --- I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be	pos

I ran into this book accidentally while doing some research. Instead of glancing through it, I ended up reading the whole book. I just couldn't put it off. Content wise, the book doesn't bring me many "light bumb moments". However, I find it extremely well written rhetorically. While the book is easy to read, it is literarily graceful. I'd suggest everyone to read it--just to enjoy the beauty of language	pos

I especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen.

Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials.  ---  --- While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills.  ---  --- After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.  ---  --- Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 	pos
For the price this watch can't be beat.  Very thin, very light, and it gets quite a few comments.

Overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair	pos

I've always loved Victorinox Swiss Army Knives, but I must admit that I when I purchased this one, I was not sure if I made the right choice, but my expectations were soon exceeded.  It was right before a trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, I had lost my other Swiss Army Knife (a Tinker), and I was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade.  I did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness.  I settled on this one because it was on sale, and I have not been disappointed. ---  --- The handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle.  For its size, it had just the right heft, but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt (where I kept it in my buttoned breast pocket). ---  --- The 4" locking blade worked wonderfully.  I could close it with either one or two hands.  When closing it, the blade pauses at the halfway point, reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed (that said, it does not eliminate all risk, so close the knife with one hand at your own risk).  During my recent canoe trip, I lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24" northern pike with this blade was quite painless (though it did take some skill). ---  --- Beyond the blade, I've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy, but the can opener blade is a primary reason why I prefer Victorinox Swiss Army knives over those produced by Wegner. ---  --- The knife shipped in a simple cardboard box.  A sheath or pouch would have been nice, but I was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip.  Since I kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip, the sheath wasn't necessary, but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife. ---  --- I recommend getting one.  You will not be disappointed	pos

This Minnesota-filmed movie reportedly has a cult-following,  --- and the reason is not far to realize.  Joe Mazzello.  Joe is a  --- 1990s and 21st century motion-picture phenomenon.  His presence --- in this movie is so REALISTIC and life-life that you forget that --- he is acting.  He was pivotal in carrying this movie.  How so? --- May I add that Joe's axiom for acting is simply:  "Just make it look Real!" He achieved this to a stellar degree in "The Cure," and also in the later fare: "Simon Birch".  Incredible acting, and I know good acting, for I was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical --- score for it.  No, I am not going to name-drop. ---  --- The Cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social/geographical/educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly --- forged and may I add that it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern, honest caring, and warm affection. No matter how many times I watch it, tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film.   --- Joe is the best! ---  ---  --- 	pos
Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release. ---  --- Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well.

If you don't need such support, then I don't know why you'd have any interest in this product--but I suppose there could be valid reasons that I can't imagine	neg
My husband and I bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son.  He liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old.  The seat is incredibly easy to clean (which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot) and it's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we aren't using it.  Both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time. 	pos
There is little more I can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal. ---  --- In perfect contrast to Emma, Flaubert introduces Charles Bovary, a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer. Soon after their wedding, Emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling Charles and yearns for a romantic interlude. Flaubert represents the absolute clichï¿½ of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding, unimpressive, and unnoticed middle-class man. Flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy, well-mannered, and well-liked young man-next-door, Leon. With a slow-blossoming relationship with Emma, Leon leaves for Paris to study law. Upon his return--and with a little experience--the two become lovers. Flaubert's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore. Thereafter, the degeneracy of Emma's lifestyle is evident, and she is brought to the brink of destruction. ---  --- In Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in France during the mid-nineteenth-century. Flaubert's descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing. Opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned Gustave Flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century	pos

Easy to learn, takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you DO need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't that great. Very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash, though, and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots, even though it touts a "sports" mode). It's a good beginner's camera, a good pocket-style camera, but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit.	pos
A friend introduced me to this coffee and I am addicted.  I am an avid coffee drinker and this is the best coffee ever.

I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small...

HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal	pos

I wish there was a space for zero stars.  We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died.

Before realising that there actually was such a thing as a car seat carrier, my husband and I used to stuff our car seat into plastic garbage bags and tape them shut. It kept the seat clean (and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean), but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport. ---  --- Then I found out about car seat carriers, and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews. It was purchased just before a trip to Colorado, and has since also been to Europe and back.  ---  --- I'm extremely happy with this item. It's relatively easy to put our convertible Evenflo car seat into, and the canvas and zippers have held up well, with no obvious signs of wear yet, even after braving the luggage belts. ---  --- The only tip I can give people is that my husband and I found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position (much like small wheelie carry on luggage), and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far, so that it's center of gravity is lower. So you might need/be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further. Both my husband and I were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably.  ---  --- For anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along, I definitely recommend this product	pos

With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience	neg

This is our first LCD TV.  Our tube TV finally died.  My wife actually picked out this unit and Consumer Reports also recommended this unit.  We purchased it directly from AMAZON on January 23, 2007.  I wanted to wait a couple of months before I write my review to see if anything happens. But to my surprise the TV is still running and there have been no problems.  We have digital HD and the pictures are great.

This is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. But to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. Using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your laser is, without particles in the air you wont see the beam. At concerts where they use the big argon lasers, they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of	pos

I wanted a good reading lamp and bought this lamp after doing a bit of research.

Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!? ---  --- Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false. ---  --- Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible. ---  --- But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself.	neg

I love these magazines.  We subscribe to Ladybug, Spider, and Cricket (each for a different child).  The stories are great, as is the illustration.  An illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines, and I figure it is the same for the stories.  No advertising, of course.  The thing I like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child.  Highlights tries to be something for everyone, so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story.  In Ladybug, we just start at the beginning and read straight through.  As the publisher will tell you, when your child outgrows Ladybug, you just let them know and they change your subscription to Spider (and later, Cricket.  That's as far as we've gotten)	pos
Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal.  But then they can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700 Sundays' is.   ---  --- Granted, the book is based on Crystal's highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night Kaddish.  Yet in ripping a page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  It probably went something like: ---   --- "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?" ---  --- "Well, I'm not a writer per se.  I just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage." ---  --- "So here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have." ---  --- "It'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads." ---  --- "Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  Here's their recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'How?' may you ask!  Well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  And using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine." ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry.  Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  In this case, the local bookstores.  Oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  People'll drink it up." ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry, Face.  Everybody loves ya.  Just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on.  Yes'sir, I can see it all now:  We've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 Hanukkahs!' ---  --- "You're still friends with that kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?!  Yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that Hanukkah song of his.  It'll be a great collaboration.  It's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 Passovers!' ---  --- "And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, Billy.  Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on Passover, you'll see. ---  --- "Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!'   You'll see.  But this will be only for our people, Billy, you understand.  So you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  But that's what authors do, they dig deep.  But you already knew that, right?  Can you dig it, man?  I knew that you could. ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry, Face, everybody loves ya!  Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  But hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  Mark my words we will.  ---  --- "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  Yes, it'll be something like 'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  It's what everybody in Hollywood's doing right now.  Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, Billy - God forbid.  No, siree, bubby!!   ---  --- "So Scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an Oscar already.  You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy.  And not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!

We'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know, Cantor, Jolson, Jessel, Durante!

As some people before me said already, this scent isn't THAT lovely. I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady. --- It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity. --- My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture! (Moschino), Live (J.Lo), Tumulte (Christian LaCroix), several Escade Limited Edition Perfumes and Gucci Rush 2	neg
After reading a few of the other reviews, I am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things.  This is a CONSERVATIVE magazine!!  Liberals, open at your own risk!  You just MIGHT encounter a differing view point than you own!  Goodness.  The articles are informative, indepth, humorous, and thoughtful.  It's a good read. 	pos
I just got back from vacation. I have a bad back, and it was sore. I was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs, I could carry my Nikon D-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably.  ---  --- Gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses. ---  --- I have other bags which heft lots of gear, and they're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot, but if you're looking to hike (and have a separate way to carry a tripod), then this is a wonderful bag	pos

Look, the fact is feminism is about CHOICE no more, no less. I have the highest respect for stay at home moms--it is the hardest darn job on Earth. But this woman is WAY off base to say that feminism sold us a lie. Feminism GAVE us a choice. It told us we did not HAVE to pretend to believe we were June Cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls.  ---  --- Personally, I could not have children and ONLY feminists have not made me feel like an alien species. I work with troubled teens, my skills do not go to waste, I spoil my nieces and nephews--I am fulfilled and happy. My sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys, she is fulfilled and happy,FEMINISM gave us those choices, ladies.  ---  --- We were not "sold" ANYTHING, we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us. IF you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world's most important job, I think that is YOUR issue and not NOW's. Stop blaming feminism for YOUR insecurities, if you are feminist--stop blaming your mother for your insecurities--you have choices BECAUSE of FEMINISM not despite it!	neg
Almost 2 years ago, my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon. We got a great deal for both phones. And two years later, both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone.  ---  --- Pros: ---  - Sturdy: It's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin        phones. I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone, the battery doesn't detach easily. Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson, the battery would also detach and I'd have to restart my phone. ---  - Compact: Though it is on the thicker side, this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it.  ---  - Good Buttons: For those who text message a lot, the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting. ---  - Menu & short cuts: On the side of the phone, you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. If you hold #, your phone goes into vibrate mode. If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up. You can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press "up," I have mine set on the calendar.  ---  - Long battery life: I'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone, but for every day use, this phone is great with respect to its battery life. There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged. ---  - Camera has flash & other neat options: You can also adjust the brightness level, have a self timer, take multiple shots, 10 different "fun frames," and 5 different colortones like sepia, monochrome (black & white and negative.  ---  - Zoom: You can zoom upto X4.  ---  - Phonebook: Contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. You can enter that persons home, mobile, fax, office and pager number. You can also enter an alias and email address. You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups. ---  - Voice commands:By pressing & holding the * button, a voice command menu appears. It's a nice feature but is not something I often use. ---  - Speed dailing: One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing. It's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person. ---  - Menu styles: There are 2 different menu styles you can use. I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design. ---  - Custom welcome and goodbye screen. ---  --- Cons: ---  - Video quality is poor and very pixelated. My phone only holds 2 15-second videos. ---  - Despite the generous 15 ring tones, it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Out of the 15 ring tones, there are only about 2 decent ring tones. ---  - Antenna: I don't use the antenna very often but when I do, it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy. ---  - Picture quality is not the best. If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone. ---  - Does not have V-Cast. ---  - No MP3 player. ---  --- Overall: This cell phone is exactly that, a cell phone to make calls. It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone.	pos

Warning: Spoilers Abound. ---  --- Okay folks, I was flipping channels and came across a movie called The Hole, starring Thora Birch, Keira Knightley and Desmond Harrington. Now, aside from this terrible blunder I'm going to tell you about in just a few more sentences, the film was fairly entertaining. I dig Thora Birch, and her character was really well-played. What really shocked me though, was my quick research after the film was over. I mean, I checked IMdB, Rotten Tomatoes and Wikipedia. Although all reputable sources, none mentioned this ridiculous mistake. ---  --- Have you ever been so utterly sure of something so blantantly, painstakingly obvious that it would literally take an entirely different, alien planet to be able to even minutely comprehend the vast insipidness of its vacuous residents? That's how I felt after watching this movie and realizing that apparently I'm the only goddamn human being on this prosaic, infantile planet who immediately saw the dimwitted aberration for what it was! ---  --- And what exactly was this stupendous error, you ask? Well... It's very simple. I mean, it couldn't get more common sensically moronic than this. The basic plot of the film is four teenagers trapped in an old war bunker. The movie begins with Thora Birch's rendition of what happened: that her friend set this whole thing up, locked them in the 'hole' and didn't come back when he was supposed to. She escapes and the three others die. The story changes from what she originally told her psychiatrist to what actually happened. Turns out the only way out was actually locked from the inside and Thora had the key the whole time. The other teenagers die for various reasons, irrelevant to the blunder at hand, and she ends up telling the tale to her psychiatrist from inside the bunker. In the end, she kills the guy who set it up and plants the key on him. The police come and find Thora and her psychiatrist in the 'hole' and after rebuking the psychiatrist, mention that the case is now closed. At that moment, a flashback shows Thora murdering her friend that set everything up and planting the key on him. Right after that moment, I said to myself: "What the heck? The door locks from the inside?! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that either a) the door was never locked, or b) someone had to unlock it from the inside!" Alright, those weren't my exact words, but good god, it's so obvious! ---  --- And that, my friends, has got to be possibly the worst film blunder ever	neg

This is a good solid phone so far.  Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual.  My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory.  Despite having something like five Meg of memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card, that's it.  The size of the text message doesn't seem to matter	pos
I bought these from a local dollar store. I thought, "Wow, all these for one dollar?" Big mistake. I LOVE painting and am good at it, but this set ruins every paper, canvas, painting at ALL. The Brush hairs fall out and get mixed with the paint. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT	neg
This is where ordering a book through the internet is a little disappointing, as you can't browse the book before purchasing it.  "Camping Activities for Kids" is very light on the  "activities."  It does a good job of laying out items that should  be brought along on ones first camping trip, but falls short on suggesting  outdoor activities for kids.  The activities that are suggested are a  little simplistic.  For example, "laying sticks apart from one another  and pretending it's a river, and then have the kids jump over it and  playing golf with sticks and using pine cones as balls."  I was hoping  for more endepth activities.  If it's your first time camping this books  okay, but if you've camped for awhile and your kids are a little older the  book falls short so look for something else	neg

Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad.  ---  --- I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this.  ---  --- Recommendation:  Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE	neg

This game is tons of fun!  My husband, children (ages 6 and 7) and I have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game.  I definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game.  This game is also great for informal parties, as an ice breaker. 	pos
Very, very happy with this appliance.  I was a bit sceptical before ordering when I read about `stamped metal' but when it arrived, yes it's stamped metal (not every component is, though), but very heavy gauge metal and very well engineered.  I used it immediately after I received it and WOW!  Talk about the `dragon`s breath!'  Very high BTU's and the food cooked like I never have experienced.  Finally, authentic oriental cooking at home.  Highly recommended. --- UPDATE:  Well, I've been using this for quite a long time now and I am even more pleased than ever.  I remember asking a Chinese chef in China town how come I can't make food like this at home.  He stated (in a heavy Oriental dialect), "You gotta use hot wok.  Wok gotta be very, very hot!"  Yep, that's the secret.  You will never replicate authentic Oriental cooking on an ordinary gas or electric stove.  "You gotta use hot wok!!" and this devise puts out the BTUs for a very "hot wok" indeed	pos
Well written, well acted, and well directed, this is much better than 99% of all films on TV or in the theatres.  the only reason it is unknown is its adult content - marijuana smoking and romantic affairs, lending amusing background to a woman's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life.  This is that rare bird, an intelligent film, for adults. My favorite line: Joe Mantegna's remark to Mia Farrow: "You're really interesting", after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible.  It is not a 5 star film, like say "Witness", but it is an excellent small film.  This is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	pos
I have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room.  I have read countless reviews of the "double faced tape foam pads" that come off right away with little effort. --- This product attached exactly as described.  I had the unit installed as well as the pads measured, cut and installed in 10 minutes.  The taupe color is very discrete on our cream, red & black brick fireplace.  I can't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried.  Great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced.  An absolute must for your hearth.	pos

Other than the Republic of Tea The People's Green Tea, I really like Yogi Tea Healing Formula. Not only is it 80% organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract (protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one's daily life. Other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches, body aches and pains, digestion, depression, immune enhancement, detoxification, as an energizer, and to prolong life. The only side effect is insomnia and I'm suffering from it but I know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day!	pos
This little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink.  It scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean.

It cleans each rail on the grate beautifully.   ---  --- The wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean	pos
Here's a real-review: ---  --- *The first 100 pages are about how her mother made her get a nose job that when wrong. --- *The second 100 pages are about the Frankenstein movie. --- *The last 90 pages are about every movie-star that's ever gotten cosmetic surgery. ---  --- And the whole thing is stitched together with an English teacher's weekend theory on how a mix of "Simulations and Simulacra" + "The Ego and the Id" explain why people get cosmetic surgery.  If you're someone who orders books online based on catchy titles, then do yourself a favor and skip this one.  How can a book on cosmetic surgery not even talk about the golden ratio?	neg
This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller.  I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this "system"  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive...  ---  --- The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The "s" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier "s" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the "arms" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!     ---  --- Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the "clips" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is "too small"??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.   ---  --- This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) "s" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to "deal" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product!!!	neg

Great flash, all the good qualities of the SB800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire! It has the built in flash disperser, its lighter than the 800, so unless you're into more info than you need, go with the SB600. Oh, it has a shorter recycle time too.	pos
As I read this book, When Madeline Was Young, I felt as though I was lost, wandering through a forest, searching for something - a beautiful butterfly, a perfect flower, a mystical cottage.  But there's nothing there.  It's just a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and nothing mystical at all. And that's how this book is written.  It is a tangle of thoughts and words, spread from the first page to the last.  Nothing special at all.   ---  --- I've read all of Jane Hamilton's books.  I loved The Book of Ruth.  Adored A Map of the World.  They were both wonderful and I will always have positive comments for them, but I doubt I will ever buy another book by Ms. Hamilton.  It's not that I want a "formula" book.  But I do want to read something that I can relate to and I don't relate to this at all.   ---  --- I don't like Mac, the narrator.  His mother is just plain strange and not endearing or believable at all.  I can't stand Buddy, his cousin.  The rest of the characters I barely know and, quite frankly, don't want to get to know.  Perhaps I've changed since her first book came out.  Perhaps the author has.  But whatever the differences, my love of Jane Hamilton's books has ended.  Sadly	neg

I bought this fireplace a few months ago and have enjoyed many a nice night drinking a martini and watching the fire.  This fireplace got me motivated to cut down the tree that died in my yard last year.  Half way through burning it!  Now for the unit.  It arrived nicely packed with all parts.  Installation was a snap, about 15 minutes.  There were dents in the screen, which is obviously part of the packing process. They are so small, though, that they cannot be seen unless someone is specifically looking for them.  The removable screens on the side are nice for adding more wood while the fire is still going.  Be sure to use mitts or tongs, however, or you will get burned. 	pos
I love this item.  We bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation.  It can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van.

but not the only one you should get.  Make this a purchase, but get live/dead also because it has all different songs, and then look at other live releases.

I got talked into buying this at the Fresh boutique in Las Vegas.  First, it's very expensive - $38, forgivable if it were outstanding.  It's not even good.  The wand isn't well made, and the product does clump on it, and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them.  I have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best, but to no avail.  The worst part is, at the end of the day if I happen to rub my eyes, it smears - racoon eyes.  I've been using Physicians formula and Revlon with the primer both are exponentially better, and I could have purchased eight of them for the cost of Supernova.  On the positive side, it washes off easily and completely with soap and water.	neg
 Well the space is limated but I learned how to deal with it. The set comes with four parts rainforestchamber, bug chamber, aquarium , and ant colony. The aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in. then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big. Finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four. the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since I bought this during winter I will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard. And we all know what you put in a bug chamber. Over all I rate this four stars due to small space. P.s there a bug catcher in it as well	pos
I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone. I was so happy to see the package to arrive since using my finger or a pen is not an optimal way to work with this device.  ---  --- Sadly these replacement parts do not match the factory specifications. These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed. This makes it easy for the stylus to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean design / look for the phone with the replacement installed. ---  --- If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase. The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised. ---  --- I am disappointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus. ---  ---  --- If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase.

I really wanted to like this but I find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours. When I went back to get a lighter color, it did the same. I think there's just too much yellow in this foundation. And considering it's oil-free, it didn't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday. ---  --- I would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you. Or if you're looking for a similar oil-free foundation, I would highly recommend Laura Mercier Oil-Free or Chanel DPF	neg
I bought this clock last week.  --- Amazon was prompt in shipping it on time. --- On having received it I place the AA battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast.

If it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in 5 minutes.  --- If not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server. The clock finds the time signal within the next 4-5 hours. The chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion.  ---  --- Once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind.  ---  --- A very good time piece	pos

Bought this for my boyfriend, and I can't stop smelling him because it's unlike any other cologne I've ever come upon.  It's so intriguing that I find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it.  I can best describe it as a soft-suede with hints of amber, vanilla, and wood. It smells better after it's been on the skin for a while.  It does  have a slight feminine scent, however, this makes me like it more, and makes me want HIM to wear it more.  It's definetely for a confident man	pos
This one is an old favorite of mine, which I pre-ordered on DVD the instant I learned it was available.  I have an old VHS recording of the film, which I have viewed many times.  I have also read the book many times, and I consider it to be Conroy's best work. ---  --- This is the story of four young men at Carolina Military Institute, a fictional military academy located in South Carolina, which is of course a pseudonym for The Citadel, which is a fine military academy that really does exist.  The film is set in the 1960s.  The first black cadet (first year cadets are called "knobs" at the Institute) has just arrived.  A secret society within the Institute, known as "The Ten" has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the Institute, regardless of ability. ---  --- David Keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet's designated mentor.  The plot moves at a fast pace, but nevertheless does not feel rushed.  Purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel.  I feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete, and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries.   ---  --- I liked the script, the acting, and the ending.  This is a wonderful film.  It is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years, and I am delighted that it will shortly be available on DVD.	pos
Am I the only one who didn't get a complete book? At first I noticed there was some poor editing - lots of typos. But then after page 180, where page 181 should be (Sleep chapter), it goes back to page 117 (Discipline chapter that I already read). It continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 (a whole 63 pages duplicated!), then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the School Days chapter that I don't have the beginning of.

I purchased this grill for my husband four years ago and we are still very happy with it.  It has held up very well.  When we were having problems with it lighting the back burner, I called customer service and they were extremely helpful.  They saved me buying a whole new burner set by explaining to me how to remove the tubes, check and clean them.  We are now replacing the racks and flavorizer bars ($60.00) since they are just too hard to clean after all this time.  I have found replacement parts at Home Depot and Lowes which is a plus to know I can easily get the parts.  I don't see us haveing to buy a new grill anytime in the near future	pos
The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP! ---  --- I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company	neg
Just received one for my son's birthday. He loves it as he has a laptop like daddy. The quality is terrible, like another user's experience the right side of the device doesn't work properly and this is brand new. Apparently the sensors on the device don't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side. I can't exchange it as I am not in the US so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are. This of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff. --- Also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old.  PS the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs Amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer	neg
Got this game for my 12 year old and he LOVES it!  You need to have a pretty new computer to use it and it took a few trys to get it downloaded.  Once it was installed it was a really wonderful game!  If you have a child that likes puzzles and figuring things out, they will love it too	pos

Purchased three of these at Christmas.  Horns and lights did not work on but one, another was missing keys when delivered, luckily interchangable.  Within 5 days, one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit, the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere, and the third had two bald tires which burst!  All this before the new year turned.  I contacted the company, and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail.  However, they offered no assistance on actual repair, telling me that "any man can do it with a few tools".  After several hours and a visit to the tire shop, I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now.  I obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive.  I would buy at a store where I could take back if needed.  Good luck.   	neg
I just bought this seat for my 9 month old son. I bought it for the convenience of the fold down front. As good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees. He is a thin baby so I don't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby. Also, the seat it self is slippery. I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don't. This is very uncomfortable for him.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier. That is really the only good thing I can say about this product.	neg
This cd is the funniest cd i own.  The first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny.  The second half is a little hard to understand, and it louds like is was recorded poorly, that is why i gave it four stars.  Track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy.  Eddie makes fun of Stevie Wonder and boxer Larry Holmes, and he does it well	pos
Ok so I read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove. Our stove is great! We took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly. The ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their Colemans. In fact several friends couldn't believe the heat this little guy produced. We love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come	pos
This is an AWESOME little device.  ---  --- Let me start with the pros:  ---  --- 1) EASY: Incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it, but it's true. Plug in the usb transmitter, press the blue button & voila.)  ---  --- 2) GOOD SOUND: For a small set of speakers, these things sound great. They are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system, but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers. There's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well.  ---  --- 3) WIRELESS RANGE: With 4 AA batteries, you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. Reception is great. I am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - I had doubts about bluetooth speakers, but I am amazed with reception these guys have.  ---  --- 4) CONTROLS: the Forward, Reverse & Pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both Media Player or Yahoo Music Engine running on the laptop(the only two I tried). Again, I was surprised, but they worked flawlessly.  ---  --- 5) COOL: As far as cool factor, this little guy is definitely that.  ---  --- Cons:  ---  --- 1) NO REMOTE: It would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound, FF, RW, Pause, Play controls.  ---  --- 2) NO CONTROL FROM PC: You can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the speakers.  ---  --- 3) SOUND: Above I said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. However, these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. It's good, but it's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system. There is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these speakers.  ---  --- 4) VOLUME: Volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room, but not much more.  ---  --- For $100, this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with NO WIRES. Carry it to your kid's room. To the garage. To the basement. No wires, nothing.  ---  --- If convenience is and portability is important to you, and if medium sound quality is ok, then I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker system. It's great.  ---  --- Personally, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them because I would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient, that I doubt I'll be able to give them up!  ---  ---  --- FOR OTHER BLUETOOTH IDEAS AND WI-FI NETWORK OPTIONS, see my post at the Hydrogen Audio forum: [...]	pos
NOTHING NEW HERE. ---  --- I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton.  This cd is dull.

I have been using Paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about 9/10 years and since then upgraded a few versions. After reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from Nuance website, I cannot justify upgrading my paperport software to PRO given its  current cost. I am pretty sure that a lot more people (especially loyal users like me) would snap it up if it was little cheaper. I will probably wait for some time for price to go down.... It will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet !!!) and become compatible with Vista. For those of you who got lotsa money (please send me some), I would recommend Paperport as a decent doc managment s/w	neg
Eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate. Conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness. It is also horrific to watch. I had heard the Parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the President's right ear. They should know, they were there right? The film shows otherwise. If there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret, show me someone who can keep a secret. If the US government is hiding evidence why is this footage available? No one can tell where a shot came from by the target's movement. The answer to where JFK's missing brain is here, the third shot pulverized it, turning it into a red mist. Had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage. This is history which cannot be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads. See for yourself	pos
I was looking for a decent sized, sectioned plate for my 1 year old to have at the dinner table and these were perfect.  I have not used them to travel with but I do not think the lids would stay on the plates very well in that type of setting.  They do work great for her leftovers though when I put them in the fridge.  They are nice and slim and fit well into long skinny areas. 	pos
I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more	pos
Adios Marks the real goodbye from KMFDM.  After they went on to do MDFMK which was decent and then they came back.  Attak, was really weak because it was all Sascha and Skold and though I like them both, the absence of Gunter Schulz and En Esch really made this album absent in itself.  WWIII though it is a better and pretty decent album, KMFDM is still a little less present.   ---    Adios gives us the remnants of what KMFDM fans know as KMFDM with Skold present but not taking over completely (Though I like Skold, But we need a break) We saw Nina Hagen lend her voice in "Witness" which is amazing, along with Ogre from Skinny Puppy in "That's All" and "Full Worm Garden" great tracks --- A little bit of Pig and Schulz's insane guitar riffs and you are all set. Even though En Esch was very minimal in the recording, infact I barely remember him...  Currently Working on "FUBAR", we'll see if KMFDM will impress again, They have it still, they are just not using their talents as of late, C'mon Sascha, you're great man, but get over yourself and get Schulz and Esch back... Bring back KMFDM... What would Skinny Puppy be without Cevin Key? what would Ohgr be without Ogre? What would Foetus be without Thirlwell? c'mon man.. Bring us back KMFDM...	pos
I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding "it all" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet	pos
I've had this grill for almost a year now and have had no reliability problems with it.  I purchased mine a Lowe's.  The grill has very good flame/temperature control and the side burner is excellent.  I grill on it seven days a week through the summer months and on warm weekends in the fall.  The heat is pretty even inside there really isn't any major hot/cold spots.  The side burner is nice since it comes with a non stick coated griddle for cooking.  I actually used this feature late fall during a power outage to cook eggs and french toast for breakfast.  The side burner without the griddle has a cast iron pot holder. The lid on the side burner is large enough you can close it when using smaller pots. Very useful on windy or chilly days.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this grill and I have had no rust or wearing issues with it.  The only drawback to the grill's design is the ignitor only works on the far left burner.  It lights the 3 burners from left to right. So If your only using 1 burner for a quick meal like hot dogs or hamburgers for 2 people you need to always use the left burner	pos
I bought these as gifts.  For the price, you can't beat it.  The tins each had a horrible sticker on them about shipping the items as a unit, I assume instructions for the warehouse packer.  When peeling them off, a lot of residue was left behind but it easily came off with rubbing alcohol	pos

For whatever reason, Weber has renamed the Genesis line Spirit for 2007. I just bought a new Weber Genesis 3 weeks ago (prior to the name change) after owning my last one for 11 years. There's a 3 burner model and a 2 burner model. If you're reading this you're looking at the 2 burner model. ---  --- Excellent product. 2 burners are more than sufficient; I don't know why they even have a 3 burner model since the 3 burner model isn't really that much bigger. The 2 burner model has plenty of room for the needs of everyday family grilling and entertaining a decent size group. ---  --- There's plenty of product info on this page from Amazon and the manufacturer, so let me tell you a few things that I do to make my Weber work best for me.  ---  --- -Most importantly...keep it covered. Amazon sells a cover...get it. Not coving it will cut its life in half at least.  --- -Cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and THAT does not make a steak taste very good.  --- -Change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink).  --- -Get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...NOT after. The build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements.  --- -Before each use, after you wire brush the grates, put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down.  --- -Pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot.  --- -Initiate cooking steaks, chops, any cuts of meat (even burgers...no, not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for no more than 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. This brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat.  --- -Cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing).  --- -Let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). This locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite), they'll run right out of your cut of meat.  ---  --- There you go. Hope that helps. And don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. Bon appetit! 	pos

Somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers: a nice Zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller, a MacLaren umbrella stroller, and in the middle this red Peg Perego Aria stroller. We have had nothing but bad news with this Aria stroller. What a clunker! As an Italian, I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous. I am only being slightly facetious. This stroller is very sleek and stylish, and light-weight, but that is where it all ends.  ---  --- The biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels. Pushing and steering is a constant battle. Sometimes it just doesn't want to go. I have really tried to inspect where the problem is, and it does not look like the wheels stick. Rather, the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller. Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean. Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off, and the baby's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable.  But the biggest problem is the handling --- it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore.	neg

When I found out Francis Collins has written a book about his faith, I ordered it the same day.  After all, we seemed to be following the same path.  I earned a PhD in Molecular Biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  Then I found Christ as a 40-year-old.  My transition was from a semi-serious Jew to a Materialist to a serious Christian.  Hearing about Dr. Collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued. ---  --- His book should be entitled "a Politician Presents Evidence for Belief".  It is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research.  The Human Genome Project is elevated to status of "bridge to a momentous new era".  Hogwash.  Hype is the term I would use.  The Dept. of Energy was duped into footing the bill because the National Institutes of Health saw it as a waste of resources.  The author couldn't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk DNA' than previously thought. ---  --- Dr. Collins then explained Darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma.  This oversimplification is typical of those who never studied Biology except at a Medical School.  This is not entirely his fault, however, since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random.  Their motivation should be perfectly obvious, but it's not even on Dr. Collins' radar.  He also uses Mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics, assuming the reader would be ignorant that Mendel's data was `dry-labbed'. ---  --- Usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either Biology or Theology.  Dr. Collins relies on two sources for his treatise on Theology: St. Augustine and  C.S. Lewis.  I happen to agree with him that the Creation Story and the books of Job and Song of Solomon have a "lyrical and allegorical flavor".  I would include the Book of Jonah in that category as well.  However, there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked. ---  --- The only time Dr. Collins makes a strong case for anything, it is to refute Edward O Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and their minions.  Even then, he uses a quote from the late Stephen Jay Gould for his most scathing criticism.  Francis Collins is the consummate politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone.   ---  --- Dr. Collins knows that Jesus was not a politician, and He did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. Take this quote from Mat 23:14 "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation."  Dr. Collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists.  In my opinion it is a  piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the Human Genome Project myth.	neg

I bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed.  Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  I prefer a softer line, so this didn't. ---  --- Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day. ---  --- I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it. ---  --- This is definitely not worth the pricetag	neg

This is a delicious basic Thai yellow curry, with some vegetables. It comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal, but I still found that with this meal, I really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes, nuts, or eggplant. I don't have any Thai places in my area, so I add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that Thai craving. The sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp	pos

The continuation of the Sims2 game renews the fun for me with every expansion pack.  The smaller expansions in between the big ones, ie.

great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds.  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it.  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film.  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job.  i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie. 	neg

The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.

When I realized early on the time I would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, I resolved that I would alert other readers.  ---  --- Generally I enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome.

The conclusion was so lame that I was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue. ---  --- My advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next	neg

I really do love this item. I've been using it without fail since the day it arrived. I haven't had any significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone. I hated wearing the chest strap on my other monitor. ---  --- The only problem I have found is that I can't grip things and have the monitor continue working. So when I am lifting weights I have to leave that finger extended, when I'm using the eliptical trainer I have to leave that finger extended.

So with the one minor exception I highly recommend it	pos

In 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the United States was $19,806. 37 million people in the US live at or below this level. Ron Sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth. In Just Generosity, Sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in America. And it is a compelling vision. ---  --- Sider's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals. Both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty.   ---  --- Drawing upon biblical study, Sider presents the goal of an economy of justice: "Every person or family has access to productive resources (land, money, knowledge) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community" (81). Sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare, minimum wage, tax credits, health care, and education reform, showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work, empower the poor, and strengthen families. ---  --- Sider ends with this troubling question: Do enough Christians really care? This book should be required reading for any that do.	pos

This book starts with the fundamentals of atomic structure and then builds on them until molecular orbital theory.  Molecular orbital theory is developed for both organic and inorganic substances.  Molecular orbital theory is used to explain the electronic structure of molecules, which is, of course, of fundamental importance to the chemist. ---  --- Bonding theories for organic and inorganic models are developed and a brief treatment is given on the solid state at the end of the book. ---  --- This is a book that I often use as a reference.  This book is versatile enough to refresh the chemist about bonding ideas in both organic and inorganic areas.  It is not a particularly advanced book, but it was a pleasure for me to read and a good book to remind me of the basics when I need it	pos
I say almost due to the fact that Aperture gives them a good run for the money. You know those photography magazines with about 10 pages of pictures and articles and the rest is advertising? This is not it! If you enjoy a magazine that delivers informative photographing techniques, get this one! If you are interested in seeing the work of other photographer's, get this magazine! If you want a hot collectible, GET THIS MAGAZINE!!! Yes there are ads in here, but not a ton of them. For you guys (and girls) out there who love to see the occasional beautiful star photographed, get this magazine. One of the aspects of this magazine that I like, is the fact that the photo layouts are sometimes full page, unlike some magazines where you have to get out a magnifying glass to view the photos. And this one IS a hot collectible, though the French version of it is an even hotter collectible. Whether it's nature,  special effects, or provocative photography, this one is a superb magazine. In short, this one is a must get for the photography fan	pos
We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys. The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel. The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out. This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for.	pos

With a good script and a director better suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha Richardson.  Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession. ---  --- The basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen).  There are several plot twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot.   ---  --- The only reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson.  She does her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best Actress award in London for this film.  However, as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job.  (In fact, I remember that in the promotional interviews Richardson, credited as an executive producer, sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out.	neg
People have been trying for years to prove that the founding cause of the Universe is natural occuring harmonies. These theories are usually the occult disguising itself as science. If these theories are correct there needs to be a 'fundamental' frequency (a demiurge style 'god of harmony') to begin the resonance. No such thing exists - see Scientific American, August 2005 'Is the Universe Out of a Tune?	neg

The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good. ---  --- In the case of CivCity: Rome, unfortunately, it doesn't just come in at "modestly good" - it comes in at "dismally poor."  I've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general, but after Civ4 came out, I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out.  And now this... ---  --- I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago.  The offerings of today have a simple pattern: the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs; the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost; and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release - they take advantage of our love for the franchise. ---  --- This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating.  It almost seems, especially with the release of CivCity: Rome, that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old.  But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games! ---  --- Stay away from CivCity: Rome.  Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs, you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good, the narration and sound effects better, or the interface to work properly.  The game is a dismal failure, and I am sorry to report that.  It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis, but they just cheesed it. ---  --- Watching what Maxis (The Sims and SimCity franchises) and Firaxis (Civilization franchise) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk	neg

This Matcha Green Tea Powder is delicious!  It does come slightly pre-sweetened, so people who do not wish to consume any sugar may need to be aware.

I used this powder to make a Green Tea Smoothie Frappe and it tasted great.  Highly recommend	pos

My mother-in-law bought these for my daughter.  At first, I was skeptical about how entertaining they would be, but my daughter took to them right away.  In the beginning, she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise, but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures.  She also loves to knock them down when I stack them up. ---  --- They won't entertain her for hours, but she's always thrilled to see them when I break them out for the first time that day	pos
Workbench is a magazine aimed at do-it-yourself type people who like to work on their own home improvements and save money in the process. This publication presents dozens of woodworking ideas for home improvement and a few for hobby, with plenty of instructions and diagrams to make sure you get it right.  ---  --- Most of Workbench is focused on the exterior of one's home. As you page through an issue, you will notice plenty of articles on building wooden decks, new porches, and other decorative ideas to improve the outside appearance of your residence. There are a few projects for the inside, usually dealing with construction of cabinets, bed frames, and other things. But for the most part, the articles deal with outdoor woodworking tasks.  ---  --- I like the photos in this magazine because the projects always look so fancy. They are perfectly constructed, clean, and well- finished and they make you want to get off your booty and start working on your own home. In many cases, the articles in this magazine do tend to make things seem a little too easy when, in reality, these projects can often take many days or even weeks to finish. But the end results are worth it not only from a financial standpoint, but also from the sense of pride you feel from a job well done. ---  --- Workbench is a little more expensive than other magazines, but for those who enjoy working with their hands, this publication is worth the cost. With some effort and some good ideas, you can greatly improve your home's appearance and value with some new outdoor trimmings. Workbench shows you exactly how to get the job done with plenty of woodworking projects to enhance your residence inside and out. 	pos

Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a delightful 1941 fantasy film that would later be remade with Warren Beatty (although not nearly as good) as Heaven Can Wait. Robert Montgomery, father of Elizabeth Montgomery of Bewitched fame, plays boxer Joe Pendleton, who is on the verge of fighting for the title. Joe is plucked out of his airplane just before it crashes by an inexperienced angel played by Edward Everett Horton who wanted to save him the pain of the crash. The Angel's Boss Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains) finds out that Joe isn't supposed to die for another 50 years and orders the over-eager Angel 7013 to put Joe back in his body. Unfortunately, Joe's body has been cremated by his boxing manager.  ---  --- Now Mr. Jordan, 7013, and Joe scour the world to find a new body for his spirit. But it has to be a body that is in perfect physical shape..."in the pink" as Joe keeps demanding. Joe is offered the wealthy body of Bruce Farnsworth who has just been murdered by his scheming wife and his male secretary. Joe at first refuses until he sees the beautiful Bette Logan who desperately needs Farnsworth's help to get her father out of jail. Joe agrees to take Farnsworth's body for just a short time to help Ms. Logan. His wife and secretary Tony Abbott are more than a little shocked to see Farnsworth come down the stairs after they thought they drowned him in his bath.  ---  --- Joe soon decides he wants to keep Farnsworth's body as he has fallen in love with Bette and thinks he can get Farnsworth's body into shape to resume his boxing career. But first he has to convince his skeptical manager, Max played by wonderful character actor James Gleason.  ---  --- Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a great feel-good, comedy fantasy with a fantastic cast. Montgomery is superb as the street-wise boxer, now in control of a vast fortune but still only concerned with his boxing career. The bickering between he and Edward Everett Horton is hilarious. Claude Rains really steals the show as the wise angel Mr. Jordan, always with a knowing, sly smile on his face. Vastly superior to its remakes, this is a great film.  ---  --- Reviewed by Tim Janson 	pos

This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself.  Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper.  We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it.  I tried to put extra padding  which worked ok, but still not great.  3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed.  I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet.  Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months	neg
I was very disappointed with the durability and time that it took to get this tent set up. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble the tent and then once it was up it could never stay up. The joining brackets couldn't hold the poles together and everytime the tent was moved or touched it fell apart. I went inside the tent to put it back together and one of the poles fell straight down hitting me under the eye and cut it. This is why I am returning it. If it's not safe for me to be in then I certainly don't want my daughter playing in it	neg
We've used this seat when traveling, and everyday use at home.  When our son was about 15 months old, I put the highchair away and started using this.

I have a Lamy Safari and a Lamy Joy (both in the colored, plastic versions---not clear or aluminum).  I got this converter so I could eliminate the waste of disposable, plastic cartridges and use the bottled ink of my choice in my pens.  This converter has good capacity (refill frequency varies, of course, with ink, nib, paper, and writing habits) and a long knob with two flats that's easy to twist for refilling.  The body is clear and makes it easy to see how much ink is left through the windows in the pen body of the Safari and Joy.  With practice, I can now fill the converter with one hand, holding the converter body between my pinky and ring fingers and twist the plunger knob with my thumb and pointer finger.  This leaves my other hand free to tip the ink bottle, if necessary.  I've been using one of these converters for years, and they seem to last fine.  It's a simple device, but I can think of worse designs. ---  --- If you don't have the same pens as I do, see the Lamy site to see if the Z24 works with your Lamy	pos

This book is a very detailed starting point for Renaisance fans. At its heart this is a socio-economic history. The clever inclusion of climate and geographic conditions presuasively explained why prosperous Capitalism grew in some regions while others remained stagnant.

The original "Candyman" sucks so bad, but everybody praises it and I kept wondering to myself, "am I missing something?"  So, I tried watching it again and it still sucked as I could not even get through it, so I figured maybe I should watch the sequels and maybe I would find something that I liked about this series.  Well, after watching "Candyman 2", one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish...again, the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme.  The villain in "Candyman" makes me want to laugh because he is so NOT scary...if you want a good laugh, watch the "Candyman" series, but if you want to be scared, you would even do better to watch "Ren and Stimpy".  In all seriousness, watch "Halloween" and "Halloween II" if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and doesn't try to send a social message. LOL.  Some people call "Candyman 2- Farewell to the Flesh" a horror movie...I just call it rubbish	neg

This is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement.  Beyond the great ideas, they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures.  I have learned how to do a great number of things I used to hire others to do because I thought I didn't have the skills - they make most projects around the house seem accessible, but not by oversimplifying the process.  Some may argue that they give too much detail, but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced. ---  --- The only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed! 	pos
Really, this is only worth 4 stars if you can appreciate all things cheesy. This is, of course, funny stuff. Really, it's the kind of music where you don't want other people to know you're listening to it, but oh my is it fun! ---  --- This one has all the ingredients of your typical yngwie-inspired power metal-album: soaring guitars, high-pitched vocals, double-bass drumming, a lot of neoclassical stuff (essentially the sound of Mozart, Bach and Beethoven, just way less complex) both on the keyboards and the guitars. And of course, trumpets and brass. Oh, how I loathe and love the sound of trumpets and brass on a keyboard. Cheese, cheese, cheese all the way! ---  --- If you've heard ANY rhapsody-material before, a song-by-song breakdown is pretty unnecessary as you'll know exactly what to expect. They really did benefit from the better production on their next album (not to mention their latest opus!) but Legendary Tales doesn't sound bad by any means, and the songwriting is solid and pretty diverse. It's just cheesy, REAL cheesy! And truth be told, since it's a metal album the guitars could use a little more 'oomph' here and there. This is more happy metal than heavy metal, but then again, they're singing about mystical lands and holy creatures, so Behemoth-like heavy guitars wouldn't really fit. We don't wanna scare our Warrior of Ice now, do we	pos

Well the only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that it's thinner. The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day. As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 4-5 hours under business use, the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are: deplorable, distressing, lamentable, unsatisfactory and unsuitable.  --- I'm really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery with the Treo 680.

I am especially impressed with the clear, crisp viewing of the moon.  I can see a few planets, but they are of course very small through the eyepiece. ---  --- I do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope.  Take your time putting it together.  Read all the directions first.  Pay special attention to the details concerning the Collimator.  If you don't know what that is, you need to.  I almsot made some major mistakes, screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone.   ---  --- If you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions, you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself, especially on a clear night. ---  --- The package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

I idiotilcy got this DVD because of Colin Firth, and, as you can see, it sucks. BTW, this is not "Prasadjonnalagadda" but rather his daughter, he just comes to buy crap, but NEVER reads the reviwes. Anyways, I had better time watching a syndicated Simpsons' episode than watching this bomb. At first, I thought that this movie might've had some potential because of the suberb stars: Colin Firth and Minnie Driver ( Good Will Hunting, Won an Oscar for it) I did not yet know Heather Grahm, but after this movie, I hate her NOW! I will admit, she was alright up until she got drunk in the car. That. Was. Annying beyond reason. ---  ---   Other than that, the film's set up is absolutly horrible, starting off with Colin coming to a town just because it's called Hope? And falling in love with someone only after a couple of days? And there is also the horrible music that doesn't fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene. Pepole, I originnaly gave this a 2 star for Colin and Minnie, but Heather is responsible for everything else.	neg
I have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product. ---  --- I am downloading Grateful Dead concerts from the internet. I want to turn them into audio or data CDs. Sometimes I get a whole concert as one giant file; I want to cut that into tracks and save it. Sometimes I get a bunch of tracks; I want to combine the songs that "go into" one another (my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks). One of the things I want to do is to save the files (which are mostly MP3s) in the same bit rate and format as the originals, so I loose as little "music" as possible. ---  --- The MP3 codec seems to be really buggy. Most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files: some go 5/6 normal speed, others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original. When I pick a combination of settings that work, I usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original (even when I'm only combinining four MP3's into one). ---  --- Try cutting one MP3 into two, and then recombining the parts into a whole. No matter what I try, there's a little click in the place where the two files are joined. This should be an easy thing, since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing. ---  --- The upshot is, buying this was $40 down the drain. I'm going to have to find better software for my purposes	neg
This re-telling of the so-called "zoot suit riots" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly.  Part of it is the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense.  Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while doing some reseach on the "pachucho" R&B music scene -- but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate production.  It's hammy and ham-fisted.  Latter-day star spotting:  El Teatro Campesion veteran Robert Beltran (of future "Star Trek Voyager" notoriety) has a bit role as a modern-day audience member..	pos
I have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great. Easy to use and quick to sterilise. ---  --- With regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment, I should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile. All babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting, and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats (and breast pump equipment) until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally. Cleaning your baby's bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs, so it's generally still advisable to sterilise after washing. If you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone, it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade. The bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition.  ---  --- It may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth, but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous. Your baby's immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he'll be able to combat infections more easily.  ---  --- It might seem inconvenient to some, but sterilising reduces your baby's chances of ingesting harmful bacteria and it's about the baby's health, not what the mother's feels she doesnt have time for. 	pos
I've found Timothy's K-cups to be consistently good, better than the Green Mountain varieties I tried (I haven't found a Green Mountain that I like yet!) But Parisian Night is the first Timothy's offering that didn't impress me. I bought two boxes of it from Amazon and have tried using different brew strengths, but it always tastes bland. It's bold and strong as advertised, but plebeian. To someone who's just bought a Keurig and had this blend as their first cup, it might taste pretty good; but compared with all the other, better K-cup varieties that are available, this one is better off skipped. I think it's just a fancy name for a boring blend that has nothing distinctive about it at all. Their "Midnight" dark roast is definitely more tasty, and even better than that are their Columbian and Italian K-cups, which are very smooth. I think Timothy's has the best Columbian K-cups on the market. But Parisian Night, well...let's just say that everybody makes mistakes	neg
With our knobs being on the front of the stove, these covers hung down over the oven door, and either got in the way, or were popped off on a regular basis (or pulled off by our 16 month old). We found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop wasn't in use	neg
Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer! Unfortunately, the idea was more a fantasy than a reality. I only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out (spring and all!) and the retractible cord stopped retracting. Since that was the only reason I bought this one over other models, I was sorely disappointed! Also, this dryer is so L-O-U-D that I had to wear earplugs (no kidding!) while drying my hair so that I wouldn't damage my hearing! Hands down the WORST hair dryer on the market	neg

I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.  It is a great investment for anyone that doesn't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	pos
I remember the first time I used WordPerfect, and the first time I used Microsoft Word.  I couldn't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior Word over WordPerfect.   ---  --- Years passed, and now I find myself using MS Word every day.  I'd been ground down by the thousands of Word users who'd picked it up along with PowerPoint and Excel, and who didn't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another.  WordPerfect _always_ converted MSWord docs.  MSWord never reciprocated.  Shouldn't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer's life that much easier?  With each successive iteration, WordPerfect introduced some new innovation, and in the next incarnation, Microsoft aped it.  It got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation, then wait the inevitable year-long interval for Microsoft to catch up, and then they'd buy that. ---  --- Well, due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license, I tried WordPerfect X3, and it was like coming home.  It's nothing short of amazing.  I went out and bought a copy for my parents, and they love it, too.  Now my brother, an attorney, has asked me to buy him a copy, since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have WordPerfect only, and can't seem to open his Word files.  The more things change, the more they stay the same	pos
I have bought quite a few barbies from Amazon recently, including the caligirl series, fashion fever series, and barbie loves micky mouse. This barbie is quite different to all above. She does not have a rubber skin like others, so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts. Her foot is quite flat; only the slippers in this package fit her; all other barbies' shoes do not. I guess this "pooh" might be made with the "former generation" technology	neg
Got this for Christmas and absolutely love it! It works for everyone  on any work out level, even for beginners.  ---  --- There are two types of work out:   ---  --- 1. Routine Builder - basically you are on your own you get to pick exercises you are interested in.  --- 2. Personal Trainer - basically you follow a 12 week program. It tracks your progress, it tells you when it is your rest day to avoid over exhaustion, it has a guide/advice on proper posture, breathing and technique. It has a good amount of stretching exercises in the beginning and end of each sessions. It even enhances balance of mind and body...very much like yoga. It also combines fluid movements like Tai Chi, rhythmic dance moves and kick boxing moves.  ---  --- Needless to say, I love this game! If you're looking for a good sweat without the high fees of the gym, this is the game for you.	pos
Quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for Intuit products and services.  In my opinion, it is fine to offer additional services to customers, but give the customer the opportunity to say "no thanks" and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software.  Forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea.  Advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity	neg
This movie came out when I was twelve and I have been in love with it ever since. It brought me, a rural farm kid, the magic of Leonard Cohen, Concrete Blond, Was (Not Was),The Beastie Boys, and all of the other wonderful musicians who grace this film. It also brought me Christian Slater in a role that I would later relate to in a big way as a teen. In short, for reasons all sentimental, I love this film. It may not have cohesiveness in the same way "Heathers" does but it has heart and that is something that teen movies seem to lack these days. So watch this flick and be grateful that you are no longer in high school. I know I do	pos
How do I assign a rating? As several other people have experienced, my unit is also DOA. I received it, plugged it in, pressed 'clean', and the motor started up. I popped open the cover, put in the disc I wanted cleaned, and pressed 'clean' again. Nothing. Terrible quality control. ---  --- What's worse is the unit case is glued together -- no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty	neg
After two decades since watching Upstairs Downstairs, I rashly decided to buy the WHOLE set!!!!  As I watched the first episodes I realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me! The melodrama was a bit vulgar and VERY predictable! Later episodes of the set improved, but not by much! It was like watching a biplane that didn't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway. I hope you won't make the same mistake I did	neg
As per the review, I decided to buy the item. I received it. It was very thick and ugly looking. It just looks good in the picture.

Overall unhappy and returned to AMAZON with loss of money in shipping	neg

amazon sells a one year subscription for $14 which includes a $5 amazon certificate that you get later. ---  --- in the actual magazine, the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $10.00 ---  --- so use the card, save some money and also dont have to wait for your $5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $5 certificate on.	neg

The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products! Beware! --- Canon, here I come!	neg
ok this is like so many other sci-fi movies of the 80's(and the second of three underwater action movies that year)that you always feel like you have seen it before. the story is about miners on the ocean floor who find a sunken russian ship near them. after checking it out the find a video tape and a flask of booze.as two crew members drink from it they get very sick,and why not ,it has a drug that changes you into a blood craveing monster. ---   not the greatest,but i had fun watching it and if gore and f/x's are your thing you'll love it	pos

I work on the news for a local highschool, and i am always about writing things down. I keep 4 new molskine notebooks in my desk at all times. I uasualy keep them in my back pocket, and sitting in classes all day with the notebook in my pocket can basicly destroy it. And i have killed quite a few of them this way. But thats my fault. They are the perfect size for your back pocket and dont get in the way too much. It would be nice if they had a stronger version of the book, for thoes who are a bit tougher on their stuff, something like riveted pages to the cover. I rebind mine all of the time, but keep in mind they get thrown down staircases, dropped on the street, and chucked into trash cans by some crazy student. Basicly because im always on the move, taping events, filming movies, and everything i have so much going on i dont have time to worry about how my notebook is going to hold up, and the Moleskine line does a good job at putting up with everything i can throw at it. I use them to record my daily notes, and use them for story boarding. The cover is tough, and the elastic extremely helpful. The back pocket is very good for keeping business cards in, i can pull out a card at the same time i write a note down! :	pos
I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005.  It has held up really well.  My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep.  I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever "made" the bed.  Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees.  The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.   ---  --- I do especially love the lamp, switchplate, mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection.  You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone.	pos
The game itself is actully pretty good.  You can go through the entire Price is right game or you can just go to each section.  Like if you just wanted to do the pricing games, there's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc... ---  --- There are times that the graphics of the game lag, which is kind of odd since to me since I wasn't playing it on a computer, but on my DVD player. ---  --- The pricing games are 'random' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games. ---  --- You can technically play this game by yourself, but it's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have	pos

I had high hopes for this book. There are too many parts that feel self-serving and pointless. I felt like I was reading the author's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation.

I found the preface by one of the author's former professors to be the best part of the book. I would not recommend buying this book	neg

I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation.  It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter.  It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too.  The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.  I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase.  I love this stroller!	pos

This is a great choice for a business casual style watch. With it's crystal clear face and smooth shape, it complements most business attire nicely.

I still get questions about it. Definitely an eye-catcher	pos

In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.  ---  --- Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.  ---  --- You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ..	pos

I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, "Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?" I replied "PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!!	neg
we have the one with brown trim, but i had to write a review here too because we just LOVE this blanket.  it's super soft, the perfect size for swaddling, and nice and light AND still warm for baby.  we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son, but doesn't cause him to wake up sweaty.  it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it's COMPLETELY worth the money! i'd buy another in a second	pos

I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. "Nope, can't do it" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, "you'll have to use another product." So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year. --- s:	neg
You can clean any kind of metal with this product.  I think you should buy it.  For the most part it's like copper and silver polish, only it's intended for metal.

This is a very basic holster, and often simple is best - but not this time. The good news: the 8700 slips right in and out with ease, the swivel works great, and the clip is reasonably secure. A minor issue, becuase its plastic, when the virbrate "ring" is active, it makes an annoying rattle sound.  ---  --- The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs (one on each side). Everyday use must weaken the plastic, becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case, which meant that they 8700 would not stay put. It slipped out and fell to the floor several times. I replaced the case, and a month later, the tabs on the new case broke too.  ---  --- Due to cheap build quality, I'd suggest you look at third-party case options instead of this one. 	neg
I purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas. I was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots.

She has been wearing them since and I'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost. In comparison to the more expensive boots, she says "no difference"	pos

I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product: ---  --- - Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily. --- - The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint). --- - The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably. --- - This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over.  ---  --- The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.   ---  --- Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand	neg

Let me say that this is the best skin care cream I have ever used and I know for a fact that it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it.   --- I've used it for a little over a year now and I won't use anything else.  I don't know the last time I ever had to use an exfoliating scrub because what this does, is an automatic scrub.  It is gradually sloughing off dead skin cells for you and rendering the use of exfoliaters useless.  --- I must say, it has a natural funky smell but you do adapt to that very quickly and won't notice it after a while.  You use it once a day for the first two weeks (while your skin gets used to it) and then twice a day thereafter if you want.  I only use it at night and a sunscreen throughout the day because the skin is a little more sensitive to the sun. --- Caution - this is an acid cream.  I once had a minor paper cut on my finger (the same that I use to dip into the pot) and I still get tears in my eyes thinking of the pain I was in.   --- This is an excellent cream and I strongly recommend it.  It won't get rid of wrinkles (you have to know that there is practically NOTHING on the market that will get rid of them) but it will soften the look of wrinkles and it will give your skin a beautiful softness and glow.  It's an amazing cream with true genuine results	pos

This kit is neat; I have to admit that.  It comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book.  However, the kit itself is a little pricey considering that A) there's only 10 pages, B) the pages are only 5 x 7, and C) the pages are not double-sided.  The software included, although as simple and easy-to-use as can be, is so limiting, it doesn't actually feel like you have made this book yourself.  Instead, it's as though you're in preschool, bringing in the pictures and having Teacher put it together for you.  You can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please, but there is seldom the precise one that you really want.  It doesn't help that half of the themes have these cutesy "scrap book" elements that look absolutely ridiculous. --- However, the book itself is pretty slick once you make many, many comprimises.  The only reason I gave this two stars is for the materials included	neg
McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend  Vollhardt and Schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry)	neg
     I won't mention about the quality of this product. But this standbag doesn't have enough weight to stand my punch.

Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, "A Clockwork Orange" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them. ---  --- Everything changes, however, when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years, he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program, designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this "treatment" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book: Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice? ---  --- The book can be a little difficult to get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence taken from the opening chapter: "He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that" (pg. 5). There is no glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice, comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for "English to Nadsat" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word can be a little difficult. ---  --- One final note of interest: The original British publication of "A Clockwork Orange" had 21 chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the book was first published in the United States, the last chapter was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change. On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us in his introduction, interpretation is up to you	pos
This GameCube is WEAK. I have owned both the NES and the Nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems. Nintendo's recent system, the GameCube, has several problems with it's design. First of all, the internal fan is slow but, quiet. After an hour or so of use, the system overheats, thus shuts down. Second problem, the wireless controllers for this system SUCK. We have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week. The brands we have tried: Pelican, Intec, Nintendo, and Osmart. The third problem is that the system was not built to last. I still have the NES and Nintendo 64, which both work great! I doubt the GameCube will last past 4-5 years of use. Simply put, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! ALSO! The Nintendo Wii is going to come out soon. From the description and from the specs, you will need to stand up and interact (move around and stuff) with the game. Sounds fun but, would you like to do that after a hard day of work? It will work something like the Sony Eye Toy.	neg
I am a mom of four, who tries to balance a limited grocery budget with the healthiest food that my family can eat.  I keep making more and more changes as I gather more information and products like this become so readily available.  Anyway, I have been concerned about food dyes lately but still wanted my kids to be able to have some kind of a candy treat.  I thought I would give these a try.  I just got them yesterday.  I haven't given any to the kids yet (I am saving them for Christmas), but I also didn't want to wait until then and find out from the kids that they were horrible.  So, I performed my own taste test of three of the flavors, and I found them to be delicious.  I know the kids will love them! 	pos

The description for this cartridge says that it "provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria" with its "Aquastat" antimicrobial technology.

It's not an antimicrobial cartridge; it's a demineralization cartridge.  Whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it	neg
This little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet, yet it is easy to take on and off. It also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat. Very easy to clean as well. I will warn you that little boys can still "shoot" over the small guard. I am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the "projection path" is downward. I have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them. This seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable. Because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat,too.	pos
This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money	neg

I have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because I wanted my kids to see it. I was very young when I first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow. Good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in Asia. --- Daryl Hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid. Tom was also perfect for the role. I can't say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, though, but it wasn't bad. I can't imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie. --- I let my kids watch it finally together with my niece. We found ourselves teary-eyed in the end. It was just so touching, we couldn't help it. Even the theme song sang by Rita Coolidge was perfect for the ending. For those who wanna know, the title is "Love came for me".  --- I'm glad I purchased the anniversary edition. I have a home theater and the dolby 5.1 surround sound was just what I needed. It would have been better if DTS was used but I'm not complaining. --- For those who are thinking of getting this, I hope you make the decision to do so. Tom Hanks is a certified great actor. This movie will soon be in line with the classics like "Gone with the wind" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's". It's already a collector's item. You won't regret it! Besides, love stories don't get out of style	neg

Unless you were a wealthy chocoholic, you would probably never blow the 50$ on these.  As a gift however, this is a great box (there is a similar all heart shaped box for Valentines - which is cool if you dig hearts).  It fits all the qualities I look for in a gift.  Its extravagant, its something the person I give it to will love, and its something they wouldn't get themselves.  I tried 2 of these, the mixed berry is ridiculously good.  The peanut butter and jelly was interesting.  Everything is superb quality wise.  I knock it down a bit on price, but honestly, its tough to find fault in this product.  It much much better than regular Godiva (which I find to be super sweet and overpriced)	pos

On an episode of Seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is, the always wily and oh so goofy character of Kramer is playing a game of Risk and exclaims that the "Ukraine is weeeeak".  This causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble.  I think the same basic sentiments work with this New Order release.  It probably wasn't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent "Rock The Shack" and of course "Crystal", which I'll get back to later.  Unlike Kramer I feel I can make this statement safely as I'm not dealing with a burly, alcohol swigging Ukranian, but New Order fans, which aren't the most intimidating bunch out there.  Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important, which it is, maybe.  This album features the guitar of Billy Corgan, the frontman of the seminal 90's group Soundgarden.  Too bad they couldn't get Billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy, and wasn't writing very good material or really using his guitar, at all.  New Order also made the mistake of having Corgan to backing vocals.  Now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough, but to top that off with a Billy Corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice.  So...Someone Like You is more or less unlistenable.  It has some pretty terrible lyrics about how Bernard doesn't want to wash his car.  Now I can relate, I wouldn't want to wash my car in Britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair, but this topic doesn't result in the most captivating and well-written material.  New Order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album, something they don't do very often, just like Van Morrison.  Now I'm not sure if I've heard a Van Morrison song but I've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars.  Case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking' is Rock The Shack.  Rock The Shack kind of sounds like New Order's take on someone commissioned to write an epic Gilligan's Island rock song, pretty amazing huh?  '60 Miles an Hour', `Primitive Notion', and `Close Range' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland.  New Order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80's artist like Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Tears For Fears (who've actually always blown).  However, they do succeed fully well on two songs here.  There is `Crystal', which is truly an excellent rock song and show New Order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of New Order's career from the 90's and beyond.  How this didn't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me, because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it.  The other is Run Wild which is really a great little slow song, in the vein of `As It Is When It Was.  Probably New Order's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic, moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album.  Get Ready is good beginning and end, just not end between.  Kind of like that movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me	neg

I had been looking at the Skagen watches for six months and could not find any sales.  They are priced around $110.  When I saw this particular model for $69, I was excited.  I read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions.  This watch arrived three days after I ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like I had bought at the store. It was brand new and I love it.  I especially love it when I get something new on sale and a great deal.  Amazon is a great place to order.  I get merchandise very quickly and at a great price	pos
We have 4 yr old twins and an 18 month old, and selected this gate as a means to block off our dining room from the living room.  We needed the gate (which already came with one extension panel) plus one more extension panel (we purchased additional) for a total of 107 inches across.   ---  --- It wasn't that horrible to install--just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours.  If you measure well and take your time, it's not that difficult.  Also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability. ---  --- As for durability, you need an adult sized hand to open this latch--my almost 5-yr-olds can't do it.  The extra foot adds stability.  The baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds.  We like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose, since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs. ---  --- As for appearance, the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things.  We've received many compliments on our wide spaces gate (and matching stairwell gates) from guests, and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we're entertaining company. ---  --- I think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate (it's not a brick wall!), or installed it wrong.  I would recommend this gate to anyone, especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace	pos

Hello all, you cannot go wrong with this watch. It is a very good looking watch. The web does it no justice. Great Deal for the money. This is the most expensive watch I have ever had, I have always worn Timex, but no more. The features in the Perpetual Calendar and the Kinetic and it also has a Leap Year Calendar, which I did not need, but no problem. If the watch sets still for more than 12 hours it actually stops. Then the moment you pick it back up it automatically reset's itself, pretty cool feature. When I received it, the watch blew me away. It was delivered quickly and tags were attached and I registered it with [....................]. I can go on........I give it 10 stars if it would let me!!!!! Enjoy.	pos
I received this seat as a gift for my baby shower, I thought it was going to be a great seat, Graco has been on the market for several years, and it's built up a reputation. But was I wrong! Everytime that I would go out with my newborn, and I would make a turn, the seat would flip over to the side, it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing. I'm a very carefull driver, specially after I gave birth to my son. You can't imagine how horrible it is, to look throuhg the rearview mirror, and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy, has flipped over and his head is hanging. I would have to look for a place to park, and have to fix him and the seat. I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible, in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest, just so that it wouldn't tip over, and it made it a little difficult to drive. --- You might say, she probably didn't install it well, but you would be wrong, it was perfectly installed, I had someone check the installation in my city, and everything was fine. The base of the seat is not completely flat, making it difficult for the seat to stay in place. This did not just happen to me, it also happened to my sister with her baby's seat, we had our children with a few weeks difference. --- I had to get a different seat, I purchased one with a flatter base, and that one worked perfectly. I will never buy another Graco seat again, I believe it's worth spending more money on a better seat, I believe ones children are priceless, and investing money in their safety	neg

I bought this package because I wanted good, high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page. (Google Werbos). --- Finally, after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things (see my other reviews), I found something that really, really works well, in a highly flexible and controllable way! What a relief! Much better than Acrobat 6.0, and other packages I have tried and reviewed.  ---     The key capability lies in the "save as" command, which includes "optimized pdf" as one of the file types. The "settings" there gives you the power to choose JBIG2 and JPEG2000 compression, the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers. And of course, as pdf, they are easy for anyone to read.  ---    An example: two weeks ago, the world's top empirical nuclear physicist, in Japan, sent me a set of 24 1-meg JPEGs for a 24-page paper. Nothing I had would read it, except Microsoft Digital Image, which let me fix the pages and crop them; in Adobe 6.0, they ended up being a readable 14 meg document. No better. I printed it out at work, and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier/scanner. It ended up 5 megabytes. (The copier was modern and "intelligent".) Then, at home, in Adobe 6, it would --- optimize it to pdf version 6, a nice 2.6 megabyte file. Today, I got it --- to 940 K (and better quality, to the eye)in Acrobat 8.0, in a controllable --- predictable way. I had previously tried many, many other options (including lots of Microsoft programs, all options). ---     If I understand what I have seen... I could have used Acrobat 8.0 DIRECTLY, without all that printout and scan nonsense! The direct control in the "save as" command gets rid of the need to do all that. What's more, --- I just reduced a 3.5 meg file (from the best previous material) to 1.02 megs. (As best I recall, I used CVISION before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs. Acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better.) ---     If you google a lot on compression and comparisons, you will see some small advantage of CVISION over older versions of Adobe Image Capture and Acrobat. But that's misleading. In Acrobat 6.0, I couldn't GET to that better compression. (Maybe if I had a PhD in Adobe, I could, but I tried hard..). With 8.0, it was easy. And the results are better than CVISION now, so far as I can tell. I certainly see no value at all in the new XPS formats Microsoft is touting, with Vista, now that something so much better is available. ---     One caveat: published benchmarks say that the DjVu format may be better yet. I did not consider it, partly because of cost, but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but DjVu might stop people going to my web page. But if Google Books popularizes it, I might reconsider DjVu. But then again... knowing what lies behind DjVu.. we might figure out something even better... eventually...  and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that! --- 	pos

It has pretty much all been said, let's just say it again 'cause I'm sure Firaxis/Firefly will plant positive reviews here. The game takes ages to load, the voice acting is silly (British? Australian? Herman's Hermits?), the progression is totally linear (ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels), the graphics date to 2002, and the citizen 'fetching' system is completely random and opaque. Sit and watch for awhile: your huts will change size every thirty seconds.  ---  --- Most importantly, boo Sid, boo.

Come on, this is 2005. Twinkies aren't "food" anymore than Cheez Whiz is. Twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies.

Everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while - I'm just as guilty of that - but eating Twinkies is practically self-mutilation. Look at the ingredients list and do some reading. Yikes!

Giorgio Armani is know for his excellence and fineness when it comes to his clothing, accessories, bags and of course: Fragrances. Acqua di Gio is remarkable, distinguished, and flawless in every sense. It has been the best-selling cologne since its release and has become synonymous with sexy. 99% of people (men and women) who come in contact with you on the daily basis will compliment you on your smell (at least in my case.) I'm not complimented on any cologne I own more than this one so I usually wear it when I know I'll be in contact with more than a few people. This fragrance is truly awe-inspiring and it proves once again that when it comes to delicate scents, Armani is king	pos
I first got this game about 2 years ago for computer.  Back then, I had a really slow computer, and it didn't work right.  I was so mad that I had wasted 40 dollars on it.  It went on the shelf and waited there for 2 years.  Now I have a better computer and play it all the time.  The earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult, not so.  The guy must have obviously been a moron, and not been able to figure out the puzzles, because the game has an average difficulty, and if he wants it easier, he can play on Padawan.  Anyway, the game is basically a first person shooter based game, where you go around blasting storm troopers, probe droids, and more.  I suggest getting this game because I really enjoy playing it, and I want to get it for XBOX too	pos

I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire	neg
This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so.  As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off.  You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door.  It just isn't going to hold up. ---  --- It's a nice try, but in the end was a waste of my money	neg

When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done. ---  --- Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind"	neg
First of all, let me tell you, this is NOT a date movie.  This is the most brutal graphic rape movie I have ever seen, and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over.  For me, that's exactly what I want when I see a movie, one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be.  I loved this movie, because it is very very well made, and the acting performances are incredible.  Yes, the rapes are unforgiving in every respect, and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times.  This is not a gory movie, except for the last ten minutes, it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity, however it really needs to.  "The Untold Story" and "Ebola Syndrome" offset much of the carnage with humor, but "Red to Kill" has absolutely NOTHING to smile about.  It is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending.  The story is pretty simple, a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he's going after a mentally retarded young dancer.  In the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady.  Enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim, and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality.  Her plan succeeds to a certain extent, but not like she planned it, and the rapist comes after her full force.  The actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational, and I might add, the musical score is perfect.  The music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts.  The actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing, one of the best performances on film you will ever see.  To end this, this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre, and I'm just getting started myself.  Not the gore associated with the two previous Cat III movies I watched, but something even more terrible and unrelenting, and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it.  "Red to Kill" is flatout a good movie, even considering the subject matter.  I highly recommend it	pos

I recently decided to go through some of my old cds that I haven't listened toin ages. Dj Cheb i Sabbah's Maha Maya: Shri Durga Remixed" was one of those cds that I came upon. This was my first exposure to Indian music, let alone world music. I wasn't really familiar with music outside of western culture. So this was a new experience for me. Listening to "Maha Maya" Shri Durga Remixed" certainly takes the listener on a trip to India with its traditional Indian melodies. I envisioned myself in the Taj Mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing. The music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me. It is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album. I however dug Transglobal Underground's version of "Kese Kese" (Where's the Sarangi Mix" right from the get go. It has a nice beat. Dj Cheb i Sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together.

At first, I thought this product was great, and I used it for a few days. Then, I noticed that my face was getting red and swollen. Now, I look all deformed. I am really upset!! The acid ate away at my face and I am still waiting for my face to heal. I called Neutrogena and they said it is probably an allergic reaction.  ---  ---  ---  --- March 23, 2007, Update: After the swelling on my face went down, my whole body started itching, and I had to go see two different doctors. The internist said that it got into my system, and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of my system. I took the medication for over 2 weeks, and used Cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching. My arms and legs are all scared. There are still marks now even though my arms and legs have healed. This was the worst product that I have ever used, and I don't even have sensitive skin. I never had a problem with a product ever!! I was very careful when I used Rapid Clear. It never got in my eyes, nose, or mouth. I used it once a day for a week until my face swelled up and turned all red. I looked like the character on Mask. Horrifying!!! I will never ever buy another dangerous product from Neutrogena, again!!!! I will tell everyone what happened to me!!! The funny thing is..... one person that I told this to, who also saw my swollen face,.... she said this exact thing happened to her with another Neutrogena product. So, I know it's not just me!

At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts. ---  --- The game is very easy. As a PSP player of Tekken:DR, complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play--especially ports that we're used to seeing on PSOne and PS2. With LocoRoco, you use 3 buttons during gameplay. The shoulder buttons (LEFT and RIGHT) are used to tilt, tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos, holding the circle button combines them, and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump. A lot easier said than done. A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http://www.us.playstation.com/locorocopcdemo. You must have v2.71 for this to work, I might add. ---  --- Besides a "career" mode, which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos, there are "mini-games" like a Mui-Mui Crane, Chuppa game, and more. You must collect a certain amount of bugs/pickories every game to play these games. Also, there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco. I haven't yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature, I presume. By collecting MuiMuis in games, you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco. ---  --- Besides all of the gameplay features, a large soundtrack is full of bubbly, interesting, and catchy jingles with unique voices. While some find it annoying, it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head. LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on. MuiMuis do, as well. The graphics are 2D like Mario, which make loading times non-existant and shows off the capability of the PSP's high-performance graphics. ---  --- In the end, LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive, simple, and beautiful to look at. It is fitted only for the PSP, and it should. Additionally, the gameplay is excellent, pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters (like Moja, who attack you or Chuppa, who catapults you into hidden areas). It is clearly worth $40--clearly. ---  --- PROS- --- Intuitiveness and Simplicity: Easy to play, fitted for the PSP --- Shows off PSP Graphic Capabilities: Beautiful to look at --- Different Maps, Characters, Colors: Very unique and fresh --- Not a Port or Re-creation/compliation: A completely original game --- No Long Loading Times: 2D graphics prevents this --- Mini-Games: Lets you take a break from main gameplay ---  --- CONS- --- Longevity: Only 40 levels makes you wish for more... --- Should've Used Characters More: Some characters pop up once... --- You have to pay money made in career to access mini-games ---  --- 5/5: FUN --- 5/5: GRAPHICS --- 5/5: GAMEPLAY --- 4/5: PLAYABILITY --- 19/20: TOTA	pos

Juliette Binoche is an amazing actress.  Since her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The English Patient" in 1996 and her nomination for "Chocolat," she's an actress whose films I seek.  "The Widow of Saint-Pierre" has a bit of irony to the title.  The opening frames show Binoche in black staring out of a window.  We then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward.  We learn that the "widow" is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from France before the big execution can take place.  We see director Emir Kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner Neel whose rehabilitation Binoche's Madame La seeks.  We keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner.  Daniel Autereil who won a Cesar (French Oscar) for his work with director Patrice Leconte for "Ridicule" in 1996 plays the lovestruck Captain who is in charge of the execution.  Spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife, he thwarts the town's sentence of death at every turn, refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore.  In the moment of ultimate irony, Neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore, which is sure to result in his own execution.  The bloody resolution and the final shots of Binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion.  Patrice Leconte has a great reserve, shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic.  This is an incredibly tragic romance, one that works exquisitely.  Enjoy! 	pos

Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.

It would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the Mahler Eighth ever recorded; I believe it is. But it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something, because after experiencing this colossal achievement, the competition (including, alphabetically, Abbado, Bernstein, Chailly, Haitink, Horenstein, Kubelik, Nagano, Olson [Colorado Mahlerfest], Solti, and Tennstedt, among others) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had. What sets this Mahler Eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy; of a transcendent vision being communicated, of a religious fervor. Mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work, such that he could bring us to the brink and say, "There. It's out there. You can't see it, but you can divine it" (and call "it" what you will: "God" or "Love" or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves). Most performances miss the mark, then, in one of two ways: by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand. The problem, of course, is that if we can understand it, it's no longer a vision, it's something mundane. In the closing pages of Wit's extraordinary (and that word, as well as any other, hardly begins to do it justice) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension. You know it's there only because you're willing to take that leap of faith. And that's what I mean when I say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor. There is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion I'm referring to here. ---  --- So let's look at the basic components of the performance, element by element: ---  --- The sound: Spectacularly natural and all-encompassing. The soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra, and the chorus, orchestra, and organ blend to perfection. ---  --- The soloists: To a letter the finest group I have ever heard. There's a distinctly Slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given Mahler's Bohemian roots, and a refreshing lack of self-importance. No operatic grandstanding here. And for the first time ever I felt as though I was missing something by not following the words (no libretto is provided, though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing. They weren't going through the motions, making pretty sounds. They had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it. To be honest, part II has often bored me to tears (with Chailly's performance being particularly offensive in this regard) but here I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout, impatient to hear what (and who) came next. And throughout it all, so importantly, there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end. ---  --- The choruses: Easily the best I've ever heard. The way they rip into "Hostem repellas longius" with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part I is unforgettable, and the fugue itself, which has never reminded me more of the "rabble" section from the first movement of Mahler's Third, literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course. That's nothing. I got chills right at the beginning of the Chorus Mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated! I have NEVER experienced anything like that before. Ever. And I don't just mean while listening to music. ---  --- The conductor: What can I say? He holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before. How? I have no idea, but when the start of part II doesn't jar, as it usually does, you know you're in for something special. Maybe it's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual, or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part (the first entry of the soloists, for instance, is so raptly caressing). ---  --- The orchestra: While they don't have the "Mahler sound" that the Concertgebouw or Vienna Philharmonic may produce, there's an earthiness (but never sloppiness) that sets them far apart from the bleached, sterile sound of too many American orchestras that make Mahler sound not like Mahler. ---  --- To sum up, then, I could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording, and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it, especially those radiant, visionary, and extraordinary closing pages. Record of the year; record of the century! It crowns not merely my Mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music.	pos

It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files.

It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt "OK"?.  "OK" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  "OK" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.

I enjoy having wireless...especially with broadband.  I have my router over 20 ft from the adapter yet my signal stays strong.  Set up is easy for most.  Although if you have a Linksys router WRT 54G ver. 2 get ready for some work.  It took me four calls before someone gave me the right advice.  Since then I have not had any problems.  A little expensive but worth it in the long run	pos
THis was the first scary movie I ever saw in the cinema, and it made a strong impression on me. The bathtub scenes were so eerie that I only took showers for a few years after I saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me. I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective, although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done. Watching it many years later, I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70's cheese that you see in many films from that era. The carpet and some of the clothes were funny, but it didn't detract from the film. Glad I bought it	pos

my son was a very fussy bottle eater.  He would never finish his bottle until I switched to a faster flow nipple.  Now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater.  He became frustrated that the milk wasn't coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect.  He is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed.  Now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding	pos

I should have ordered thru Amazon to avoid the confusion, since they state the vercsion needed, but where I ordered from did not mention the 5.5 version requirement, and on the box cover, THERE IS NO STIPULATION ABOUT THIS, only a generic statement that a previous version is required. How hard would it be for them to print on the box what versions will and will not work?????? ---  --- Adobe Customer Service would not budge, so I am returning the product. Of course, Christmas is ruined for the person I bought this for, and I am out shipping and handling charges. Thank you Adobe. Obviously, I can't recommend anyone buy from Adobe at this point. It's easy to see why warez are popular when companies are this foolish	neg
Bought this umbrella last week (9/23/05) from Amazon. Was initially hesitant about purchasing it due to other reviews describing the issue with the pole being in two pieces, which, when connected, were never straight.  ---  --- All I want to add here is that I did not experience this problem. The screw mechanism which joins the poles seems sturdy, and the pole appears perfectly straight. I wonder if other people had bought umbrellas from a bad batch or that the manufacturer redesigned the connection mechanism? (The most recent reviews do not mention this problem) ---  --- Re. overall quality, I can't speak for how the pole or the umbrella itself will wear over time, but at least initially it looks to be of good quality and sturdy construction. One thing to note is that despite the product description and picture making it look like the pole is made of wood, it appears to be actually made of some sort of metal which is wood coloured (it still looks like wood though and would not look out of place with wooden patio furniture). To be honest I actually prefer this, since I would imagine it won't discolour as easily as natural wood and should be longer lasting. ---  --- In summary, am very pleased with my purchase - I would happily recommend it to others looking for a good quality umbrella at a very reasonable price	pos
This toy is not good at all! its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect. its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand! plus it the picture moves, thats it! you have to start all over again. its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way, trust me i ended up just doing that	neg
You want the greatest zombie film ever made in the most deluxe version DVD possible today? Buy this set today, as it includes 3 versions of the film, including Argento's take on the film, known as Zombi: Dawn of the Dead. ---  --- Dawn of the Dead has that 79 feel, with wide camera shots that allow the characters to breathe, unlike so many modern horror flicks that smother the stars with endless closeups. ---  --- The zombie gore is to be noted, as its quite gory near the end of the film and at some parts throughout, but no real feasting occurs till the end, for the ultimate payoff. Yes, the zombies are pasty and fresh, since the outbreak has just began, which joins a team of four who struggle to survive in a mall while the world is quickly overtaken in this, Dawn of the Dead, easily the strongest Romero entry, and amongst ALL zombie films	pos

The only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet.  But the real promise of this kit--to see a model volcano erupt--may not be fulfilled.  We followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base (above mentioned cheap plastic sheet) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill-fitting stilts.  A poor experience for the kids.  The eruption was more of a fizzle.  Waste of money and time	neg
Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand.  I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them.  That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence.  It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines.  I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk.  Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself.  I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem.  I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence!	neg
Obviously some people don't care about reviewing an item, just about bashing a pop artist that doesn't deserve it. ---  --- Anyway, I think it smells great.

Also be sure to check out Fantasy, I think it smells even better	pos
These freeze dried strawberries are fabulous.  I use them in everything from cold cereal to oatmeal and even as an ice cream topping.  Most recently, I've chopped them up and added them to a batch of Rice Krispy treats (receiving rave reviews in the process!)  They're also great to snack on plain.  They have a light, crisp texture but they are not crunchy and they absorb moisture immediately.  Although 8 ounces doesn't sound like much, you really get a very generous quantity of these lighter-than-air strawberries.  I recommend this item highly	pos

We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby. Disappointed it didn't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs. I'l be replacing it with a different product, obviously	neg

I just recently bought this game for about $10 dollars.  I had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox(I've been a PS2 fan for a while).  After I played the first couple of levels I was not dissapointed.  This game is simply amazing even today, I can't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out.  The gameplay is terrific, and so are the graphics.  The sound and music to the game is awsome.  I highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning	pos

What company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won't work. Incredible. My experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written. It just shouldn't be this way. ---  --- When I finally did get it working, after tweaking some settings, and spending all freaking day on the Linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house. ---  --- I do have to say the their forum is top rate. The people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don't want to go through scripted support suppliers. ---  --- Product wise a very disappointing experience. People wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good	neg
I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.   ---  --- I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD.  Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.   ---  --- This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless	neg

This was a gift for my son who is learning trumpet in his middle school band.  Purchasing it was cheaper than renting one for the year.  We are by no means musical experts, but he can play it as well as the expensive instrument we were renting (valued at $900), and it sounds the same to me.  The mouthpiece is a bit smaller than his former trumpet and that took a bit of adjustment, but now he has no problem with it.  The case isn't real high quality but with proper care should be fine in the long run	pos
Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.	neg
An even though it's fiction, the incidents seem to fall out of the movies context to become contrived. Boring nonsence on a teen hormone kick	neg
I bought this item after being bit in the face by a spider while I was sleeping.  It was not a pleasant experience!  We stirred them up after poking around in the attic during an afternoon.  I was finding the nasty buggers everywhere until I got this unit.   ---  --- Since plugging the Bugfighter in, I've not seen a spider, or any insects, on any of the 3 levels of my home.  I have one in the basement and one in the upstairs hallway.  They've been running about 2 months now.  We've even re-checked the attic, and not a spider to be found.  I'm in Northern VA and we're coming into Spring now.  It will be interesting to see what happens.  Usually I get crickets and a bout with ants and termites as the season kicks off.  If I don't post an update, you know all went well and there were no insect battles this year.  If I have ants and/or termites...you'll be the 1st to know! ---  --- Specific point...no noticeable change in electric bill for 2 months of use. 	pos
I enjoyed this game quite a bit--I ended up putting all of the other games I was playing aside to just finish this one.  You play as the three Baudelaire kids.  The story follows the 2004 Lemony Snicket film fairly closely, as you must first escape Count Olaf's decrepit mansion, then avoid being killed by a train before you head off to Uncle Monty's herpetology paradise, Aunt Josephine's seaside town, and finally save Violet Baudelaire from a fate worse than death.  The environments are attractive and fun to explore, and the game play and puzzles are neither too easy nor too challenging and frustrating. ---  --- For most of the game--as you explore environments, solve puzzles, search for secret rooms and such, you can switch between Violet and Klaus Baudelaire as you please.  For many "important" events, such as boss fights, you must play as one or the other, as they each have different skills and weapons.  For some sequences--those that are basically 2D platformer sections (the entire game has some platformer aspects, but it's usually loosely employed and 3D), you must play as Sunny, the baby Baudelaire (and this is the only time you can play as her). ---  --- The various puzzles and challenges--they almost amount to a series of "mini-games", are varied and mostly non-repetitive, helping retain your interest.  Some are fairly easy to figure out and perform, but some are appropriately more challenging, both mentally and in terms of manipulating the controller, and take many tries to complete.  A couple first-person shooter sequences (the game is mostly in a third person mode), are especially challenging, particularly the end, but that's the final boss fight, so that's to be expected.  Like most games, winning boss fights requires discerning patterns in the bosses and adapting a strategy appropriate to the pattern, which takes both brains and manual dexterity. ---  --- There are a couple negatives with the game, but they are minor.  Games like this, released in response to the success of a film, are often rushed through production.  That becomes evident here in the cut scenes, which are not very exciting--they feature 2D black and white sketches that are more like a slide show as major portions of the story are read to us.  But I'd rather have skimping done in cut scenes than in game play, and that's just what was done here.  Also, although the graphics are wonderful for the most part, the visuals are a bit dark overall--I found it best to play with the lights off.  With a bright overhead light on, the glare was too much to see important information in the game.  Finally, I would have preferred a different save game scheme, as you can only save when the game asks if you want to, and the save points seem almost random.  Sometimes you can save after accomplishing only one more minor task.  Sometimes you have to do long sequences (and sometimes a number of challenging ones) before you can save again. ---  --- The game isn't quite as funny as the film and doesn't have exactly the same "magical" atmosphere, but it is an engaging and fun journey to another world.  The soundtrack, by Jeremy and Julian Soule, and inspired by Thomas Newman's great soundtrack for the film, is also a major asset--I found myself wanting to explore levels again later on as much to hear the music again as anything else	pos

I have been using Cindy Crawfords tapes since 1993. I used shape your body while I was pregnant 10 years ago ( Don't be horrified )  living in the tropics and with a few adjustments I did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking. I had my first birth naturally and within 3 Hours and had the best legs ever. ---  --- My first impression of Cindy was that she is honest. She does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a Genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the DVDs.  I have tried many other celebrity videos and you just don't feel comfortable with them. She does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time. Really  she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy.You cannot help but like her. ---  --- New Dimension is fantastic I have started doing the 10min workout everyday. You do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas. People can workout for an hour and not get the same results. --- New Dimension is not just a post pregnancy DVD . This is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the DVD are more than you will ever need to work all your body . I still mix it up with first two DVDs --- I have just purchased the set of three DVds again to replace worn out copies . Cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time. --- Please enjoy !!!!!!	pos
I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable	neg
This bracelet is very simple and elegant. The pavé cz has a great sparkle, but isn't overboard. I also like the fact that it's a rolo bracelet--the links are delicate and small, but very sturdy and have a nice gleam to them. Furthermore, the charm "O" is a nice style and doesn't look gaudy. There are some tiny little dots on the back of the charm (not so sure what those are all about). ---  --- This bracelet looks great stacked on top of my silver bracelet watch. Wearing any bracelet can make it hard to type, but this one is cool because you can actually peg it nice and tight to your wrist by wrapping the "stick" part of the clasp beneath the rolo chain if you want it out of the way.  ---  --- I get compliments every time I wear this bracelet; so, it's nice that it supports a good cause since it does get noticed. Obviously, if you're looking for fine jewelry, this might not be your choice, but as they say, "Diamonds are forever, but CZ is for right now." ;-) ---  --- I would recommend this for those in their teens, but even for women in their twenties and thirties who like the whole sterling-silver bling-thing. Also, definitely recommended for those interested in supporting good causes such as ovarian cancer awareness.	pos
I must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better Hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were.  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was just an equation I learned.  Hawking made it seem like common sense. ---  --- Hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times (and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points! just in case you missed them!), but all-in-all, this was a quite readable account of what's presently known about cosmology.  I use the term "presently" guardedly, as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter (it exists!), but from now on, when there are new findings in physics, I want Hawking to explain them to me, because I feel like then I might understand them.  That's why you should read this book.  ---  --- The reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life, and would rather read about global warming or Darfur or something a bit more topical and practical.  This was still a hard read, and I feel like I grasped maybe 80% of it.  For you to decide, but for a former engineering student, this was something I wish I had read when I was taking physics	pos
 I THOUGHT MY FIRST ISSUE OF YOUR MAGAZINE WAS A LITTLE SPARSE. IT WAS A VERY THIN ISSUE. THE MODELS WERE BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS GOOD.BUT YOU KNOWIF YOU WOULD INCLUDE MORE IN DEPTH ARTICLESSUCH AS REALLY IN DEPTH STUFF ABOUT SKIN AND HAIR.

This is a wonderful item IF or WHEN it works.  It prints the pictures beautifully IF it works.  The trouble is that after using it for a little while (and I mean a little while) It will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink.  I have messed with it and messed with it, for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this doesn't work all the time.  Right now my printer won't work and I cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink aren't cheap.  I think it is cheaper going down to WalMart and using their instant photo machine.  This is not worth the money or the aggravation!!!!	neg
I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.

Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools. 	pos

This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.

The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.

Investment Banker with a conscience, Ben Hartman, and special agent Anna Navaro's plot lines and bodies soon become intertwined in their quest for the secrets of Sigma, an elite cabal with roots in Nazi Germany that is bent on world domination. What starts out as reasonable and entrancing enough genre pulp becomes sheer Bond by the end, but there's no denying Ludlum has a gift for keeping the heat turned up from page to page. ---  --- If you are new to espionage fiction and have even slightly literary sensibilities, run don't walk to writers like Alan Furst, Graham Greene, or even John Le Carré. But if strong characters aren't a necessity, you are able to suspend your disbelief, and you are lusting for pure literary sugar, you probably won't be disappointed. ---  --- Ludlum is a great author for those who typically spend hours in front of the television and tremble in anticipation at the release of the next Hollywood blockbuster, because he provides essentially the same experience in written form.  He is a master of the wildly oscillating plot line, but barely approaches apprentice status in any other literary area.  I found myself cringing in embarrassment for the author at many points, but to his credit I was compelled to continue turning the pages until I had reached the end.  It's like candy, you can't stop eating it but feel ill once it's gone. ---  --- If you are a die hard Ludlumite I admit this is my first foray.  Please point me to a better example of his work if one exists, otherwise I'll invest my time elsewhere and catch up on Mr. Ludlum by proxy when the next "Bourne" film comes out	neg
I'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name. However, I love all the other features in the magazine! It is Cooking Light, but there is so much more - always an article on a travel destination, an article on beauty, and an article on a sport, as well as other constants. The theme of the magazine is total healthy living, incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food, though I do think that it is mostly a food magazine. I gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good, some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive. 	pos
I bought this for my son's first birthday.  He loved it!  But, after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it.  He still plays with it a little bit, but not like when it made noise.  I wouldn't have wasted my money if I had known the batteries would only last a month	neg
As a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools, I've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels.  While I've managed to master that skill (can shave hair off my arm with these tools), putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare.  I've tried numerous methods, none of which has worked well. ---  --- About a year ago, I puchased the Spyderco sharpening kit.  Read the manual, watched the DVD, put my kitchen knives to it, and......ended up with pretty dull knives.  Frustrated, I put this kit in a kitchen drawer. ---  --- Fast-forward to last week.  The kitchen knives are dull again, and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives.  So, I pulled out the Spyderco again and gave it another try.  This time, I tried sharpening my serrated bread knife.  After just a few strokes, it was good as new.  So, I tried it on the straight knives again, but only got a modest increase in sharpness.  Now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel, I tried sharpening my Swiss Army Knife.  Again, after a few stokes on the Sharpmaker, I had a wicked sharp knife. ---  --- I was down in the workshop today, sharping my plane blades and chisels.  The last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane...the blade on these is very convex, so sharping it is always a challenge.  Fortunately, it does not need to be super sharp, and never has been.  The Sharpmaker was sitting out, so I said "what the heck", and gave the scrub plane's blade a few freehand strokes on the Sharpmaker...no sharpening jig to hold the blade like I normally use.  For fun, I tried to shave hair off my arms....AND IT WORKED!  I couldn't believe it...this Sharpmaker makes sharpening TOO easy! ---  --- It's American-made, very well thought-out, and works amazingly well when your blades aren't made of junk steel.  What more could you ask for? ---   	pos
Esquire has gone through a lot of changes over the years. It went from a old style GQ clone to a magazine that has broadened its writing, reach, and content. Esquire now occupies a unique nitch in the world of men's magazines. It offers intelligent, thoughtful commentary on life, music, movies and celebrity, occasionally good fiction, good advice columns, a special but brief look at an extraordinary woman in each issue, and heartfelt stories on real issues that affect men, like an author detailing his battle with cancer. Another big bonus, Esquire is not oversaturated with advertisements when compared to GQ and other similar magazines. By comparison to some, Esquire is about 1/3 the size for the same content. ---  --- Esquire also annually publishes the world's sexiest woman issue. Entertaining and well photographed, it sets Esquire apart because they also chose to celebrate the beauty of women in their 30s, 40s and 50s, rather than concentrate on the month's latest piece of starlet fluff.  ---  --- At under a dollar an issue, Esquire is one of the best deals in town, and is the perfect non-expensive gift for someone in your life Most magazine subscriptions end up costing you an arm and a leg, but this price is well worth the content.   ---   ---  ---  --- 	pos
Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers. It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion. According to Wikipedia, its Scoville heat (fire) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco's 2,500 to 5,000 rating. Who needs that much heat? Not me or most human beings. This stuff is lethal. No thanks.	neg
I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.  No more multiple clicks to create customer reports.  It is just plain easy, and the information pops up on your screen immediately. Congratulations to Intuit on a job well done	pos

I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!	pos

My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.	neg
Dr. Mark Albion is a consistent and heartfelt--seemingly lone, sometimes--voice of responsibility and truth in what's often a cynical, clutching corporate world.  I was energized by his first book, "Making a Life, Making a Living (ML2)" and empowered by "True to Yourself." ---  --- Albion builds upon the strengths of ML2 in his most recent title with practical, actionable strategies for transforming your business or career into one of real social value.  Readers walk away with principles they can start executing tomorrow, and a re-calibrated moral compass by which to measure their progress. ---  --- And Albion lives it:  While admittedly starting out with some privilege, he bravely walked away from a tenured position at Harvard Business School (simply unheard of) to follow his heart.  To this day, Albion continues to shun the easy money, and lives his life by the values he preaches.  You can practically count on one hand the number of businesspeople out there who truly walk the talk. ---  --- Whether it be the insatiable drive for "more," or just the rudimentary economics of opening the doors everyday, any business can very quickly shake you free from your social moorings.  If you feel like you've lost your way, or just need some inspirational words ahead of that next challenge, "True to Yourself" is the book for you	pos

I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones. --- Hope this helped, good luck	pos

These are wonderful! My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms. ---  --- While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe.  ---  --- I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow. ---  --- I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one. ---  --- Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby.  ---  --- We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally.  ---  --- We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one	pos
If philosophy makes it for my skin, I think I own it.  I love the microdelivery peel kit which came with 30 of these pads when I bought the set.  The micro-peel is awesome, but these pads were disappointing.  They dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit.  I have seen no difference since I discontinued using this product.  Seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths	neg
I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance	neg

I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago, so I got a good deal on it. Well, as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard. Other than that I have had no problems, call reception is great. The camera on this phone isn't the greatest but I don't need it to be high end for the basic fun pics I take. If you're looking to get zoom in, larger, clearer pictures this isn't the phone for you. The camera screens can be a bit confusing but I've learned to deal with it & my pics come out as I like. A strange feature is the speakerphone, while it is quite loud & clear, Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound. Aside from these things, I love my switchback. The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small.  --- As far as plans are concerned I don't have any problems w/ over charges since I have the 18 cents/min plan. It's good to know that the monthly plans aren't recommended though. A bonus to the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service, where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips. Good for purchasing games or ringtones w/o using up your top-up money. --- And this cell isn't only for the young crowd, I'm an over 25 mom. I got this phone b/c other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones & those that do require addt'l internet service plans (like Blackberry's, Black Jack & Palm TREO's). I only wanted to easily send txts & have it in one compact phone. This was ideal for me	pos

Many great things have already been said about this lens, and I will support them! ---  --- My copy delivers outstanding sharpness (nearly on par with my 24-70L) even *wide open* (rare for a wide angle of all but the finest German manufacturers), great color, very little distortion (many objective tests have revealed that it's probably the "best of breed" ultra wide angle), and impressive contrast. Surprisingly, the build quality is not bad: tight fitting mount, damped rings, and no jiggles or rattles. ---  --- If I were forced to offer a (slight) negative, it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat "marbly"...However, when shooting a subject with an OOF area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame, then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh! ;) ---  --- A fine lens, Canon: definitely worth the premium over the Sigma and Tokina rivals (both of which I sampled before purchasing this optic)	pos

It dose good for the bikini area. However you have to hold it at a back angle for the tweezers to grab the hair properly. It did not work on legs at all. It would pull a few hairs but broke the rest. With out the guard it feels like it is scraping the skin. The tweezers area is so small it would take a week to finish a leg even if it did grab the leg hairs. Razor attachment dose not work to my satisfaction.	neg
Apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well, nearly unwatchable. ---  --- What's so bad about it?  Well, how shall I begin . . . ---  --- (1)  Sean Connery is a dud.  There can be very little doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like he's just going through the motions.  To be fair, he had no decent material to play.  The only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before.  But these are grace notes; by and large, Connery is stiff as a board here. --- (2)  The action scenes are uninspiring.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes.  Here, the action is strictly second-rate. --- (3)  Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible performances. --- (4)  There is literally no reason to see this in favor of "Thunderball," of which it is a remake; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this remake makes ZERO improvements.  In fact, the plot merely becomes muddled. --- (5)  There are a series of awful performances in supporting roles.  Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief, are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place.  The actor playing the "new" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't very good, either. --- (6)  The music is bad.  The title song is boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I couldn't care less that the James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's bad, it's what IS there. ---  ---  --- All in all, I'd have to say that -- unless we're counting the 1967 version of "Casino Royale" -- this is THE worst of the James Bond movies.  It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my opinion	neg
I bought htis from Amazon, and have troubles in playing back the video clips. Almost evrytime, after a while, I do see "System error" on the screen, and then the firmware is hung. After a power-cycle, the last recorded clip is gone! Some issues with the basics...so I called Sanyo service, they said this is happening because I'm using a 4GB plain SD card. Acc to the support guy, max of 2GB of plain SD is supported , for more GB, a SDHC card is needed. I could not find this info on the manual or spec...so I'm not sure how true is this. If anyone of you know about this , please let me know. ---  --- Video is okay for my need...still is too bad.  --- Firmware is just about average..not too great. There is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons. ---  --- Battery did not perform as promised in the spec.  ---  --- Also, there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product. I would expect those many in a robotics kit.	neg
I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)	pos
Although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll-----the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it (commonly called sushi vinegar)--------the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling-------I have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant---------the soy sauce is OK but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sush	neg

I've spent years camping with a bag of clothes half-strewn around my tent, so a new tent led me to check this out to see if I can stay organized. ---  --- The closet comes in its own thin carrying case.  It looks complicated at first opening, but it's easy to insert the fiberglass rods, zip down the corners, adjust the Velcro seams, and BOOM! you've got a very sturdy and roomy set of shelves for socks, shorts, t-shirts, towels, and medication.  There's a zip-down mesh cover to keep things out of your stuff yet keep it ventilated, and it rolls up out of the way.  Pockets on the sides for pop/beer cans, wallet, and the like are very handy, and hooks for keys on both sides let you keep things where you can find them easily.  There's even a pocket on the back that stores magazines and maps.  But the value is in keeping things organized, OFF the tent floor, where you can see that stuff without having to paw through a duffelbag and toss things all over your tent.  I'm happy to have found this neat piece of tent furniture	pos
I hate, hate, hate this potty!  The shield will not stay on.  My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying "here you go".

I put off buying this for many years.  Having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous, I didn't want to taint my perceptions of the Queen legacy.  So I ignored this album.  Then, one day, I was listening to Innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again.  I came here and read many positive reviews, so I took the plunge.  I came out the other side very content. The legacy had not been tainted. ---  --- The album is uneven in places, but the songs that are good are VERY good (Mother Love, Let me Live).  With some albums like this, it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in.  Now, I don't know exactly how this was done, but the songs feel seamless, even the dance track "You Don't Fool Me," which I can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club.  Of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out (especially in "Mother Love"), but upon the conclusion of the album, I want to say to the Brian and the boys (men), "You've done good.	pos

I bought this stroller from my daughter, thinking we could transition into it around 6 months.  She hated it.  The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat.  She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller.  After several months of use, the wheel fell off.  Also, the stroller is hard to stear.  You need both arms on the stroller to push.  If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction.  Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body, she prefers other strollers.  I bought a cheap stroller from Wal-Mart and have been ten times more satisfied.  This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam, which I assume is better.  I would not recommend it to another consumer	neg

It all started when I was a little kid and my dad gave me this album (he wasn't a fan, he probably picked it up with a crate of used records.)  It was one of my first exposures to rock and roll.  Nearly 30 years later I still own the original vinyl (the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover.)  I am glad to have it now on CD, the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable.  I dissent the reviewers who praise DuCann over Crane, for really, it IS after all Vincent Crane's project (Crane, also organist for Crazy World of Arthur Brown.)  A keyboard player myself I consider Crane one of my biggest influences and I hold great admiration for his playing.  DuCann and Hammond also deserve praise for their performances, but it should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock band is: Um, the audience ... er, no the organist!

This is my favorite Spielberg movie. Most other directors would live off a film like this for the rest of their lives. For Spielberg, this is almost a forgotten movie.

Normally I wouldnt write a review, but I have had numerous experiences with this camera that I thought I would share. ---  --- My sister first bought the camera, and I was amazed with how user friendly it was and I thought the pictures turned out pretty well.  Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage. ---  --- Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck.  I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work. ---  --- And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken. ---  --- I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.  But three times? I dont find this to be a coincidence, and I do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months	neg

F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title.

I have been using Frederic Fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so I thought I would try the luscious curls.  It was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  It left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  When it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  I have used Loreal's Professional line prior to this and I will definitely go back to it.  It's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.	neg
This toy is a favorite of my 10 month old. He likes the crinckle fin and the mirror. He also loves the music, which calms him down when he is crying. The music is soothing and doesn't grate on our nerves even though we've heard it many times.  ---  --- My only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play. It would be nice if there was a setting to have them play a few or more times. There are pictures with words on one fin that are useless and there to fit the Einstein theme. ---  --- All in all, a good product that I would buy again. ---  --- By the way, the thing he is wearing on his head is a diving mask and a snorkle	pos
I like that the gloss isn't goopy or sticky, and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while, but you don't get much product. I bought Flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color, so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips. I wasn't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen. But overall, I do like it, but don't know if I'd buy it again	pos

This retelling of the SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was actually based on a script that Billy Wilder wrote before immigrating to the United States from Germany, but it was only after the success of the Disney version that a demand was created for it.  The enormously versatile Howard Hawks (quite literally the most versatile director in film history, the only director to have mastered and/or created five or six genres) took the script and turned it into one of the last great pre-WW II comedies.  The story is simple:  a group of monkish scholars living together in New York City are writing an encyclopedia.  One of them is writing about slang, but being unfamiliar with contemporary argot begins research his topic by talking to people outside his normal range of acquaintance.  He runs into gangster moll Sugarpuss O'Shea, who takes advantage of the scholars to move in with them in order to escape the police, who want to talk to her to implicate her guy Joe Lilac.  While hardly Snow White, she certainly managed to stir up their lives. ---  --- The film is made wonderful by a number of things:  Wilder's clever script, Hawks typically deft direction, a solid performance by Gary Cooper, but most of all by a scintillating job by the overwhelmingly alluring Barbara Stanwyck and a stellar collection of veteran character actors playing the seven dwarves.  All the latter are great, but special mention has to be made of Richard Haydn (who excells even beside the others, with his extraordinary overpronounciation of everyday words), Oskar Homolka, and S.Z. Sakall.  There are few more delightful collections of character actors in any Hollywood comedy.  I personally prefer Barbara Stanwyck to any other actress in Hollywood history.  She possessed an emotional immediacy that no other actress could approximate, and while her skills were perhaps a tad below those of someone like Katherine Hepburn, the latter never managed to match her fire and passion.  And she is so sexy!  I grew up watching Stanwyck on THE BIG VALLEY, so when I first started seeing her great roles from the thirties, forties, and fifties, I was absolutely stunned at how sexy she could be.  She was attractive, yes, but sexier than she was attractive.  And she was never sexier than she was here, with the exception of her role the same year in THE LADY EVE. ---  --- Another reason to see this film is the appearance of Gene Krupa in the early nightclub sequence.  Krupa had, of course, been with Benny Goodman throughout the thirties, so this was very early in his career as leader of his own band. 	pos
Green bell peppers are very versatile; great for stuffed peppers, salads or sauteeing with Italian sausage.  I'm a big fan of all peppers, and would give most all peppers a high rating...I had to bump the bell pepper down a star for its low rating on the Scoville scale.  Bell peppers rate a 0 on this scale of hotness. Just a little bit of spiciness would make these peppers a definite 5-star vegetable, due to its versatility and delicious capsaicin taste...but alas, the bell pepper is void of that magical capsaicin, and thus a 4-star vegetable	pos
Bought this, spent 15 minutes studying the manual, plugged it in, and it worked first time -- read out the "check engine" code, and, when later plugged into a PC, allowed the details to be printed in a nice report.   ---  --- The only negative I've noticed is that when you reset the "check engine" code in the car's computer, it erases the reader's memory of it, so you have to do the PC printout before resetting the code. ---  --- Some folks believe that if you use a device like this on one car it's "locked in" to that car and can't be used on a different car.  This is not true -- I've used it on several different cars with no problems	pos

We own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean (cobwebs, ceiling fans, windows,etc.) that are out of reach.

My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple.

I haven't traveled with the bag yet, but the quality seems good. The bag has a cloth-like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal. My stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized. The stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag (the top thin long end is where the zipper is). They are removable wheels, so its no problem. With all the wheels on, the bag can't zip closed. That is why I gave it only 4 stars. I bought the bag because I will be traveling overseas soon and I don't want my stroller damaged during the long flight.	pos
I am quite fond of this character.  Sure, he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong, but you have to understand where he's coming from.  As the Hulk, Bruce Banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity.  Then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust, the world is a wasteland, and, as the Hulk, Bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation.  Fusing his mind to the Hulk's, I think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry.  This highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book.  He may not make a great center piece, but the figure is good looking, none-the-less	pos

We have used QuickBooks on a PC since the 1990's.  We loved the way Inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting.  QuickBooks for Mac is TERRIBLE in comparison.  If you plan to use the payroll features, it is unusable.  QuickBooks Mac payroll redirects you to the internet, where it is handled by PayCycle (an independent company).  Payroll is not integrated at all in the Mac (instead import/export operation). On the PC, it is part of the QuickBooks application.  We could not get job costing to work, and the tax calculations made no sense.  We were paying TONS of money to PayCycle, so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically.  We finally reverted back to QuickBooks for Windows and are MUCH happier with Intuit handling our payroll	neg
After the debacle that was Dirt I tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  Well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  Is this a joke.

The Weekly Standard clearly has a conservatinve "bent."  However, it is not the sort that screams, "This is the ONLY way to think about this topic."  It is thoughtful commentary, delivered with well crafted writing.  I come away from reading an issue thinking that I have been well informed	pos
I ordered the HappyLite about 4 months before they even shipped the product, because it was the first reasonably priced (and sized) light to help treat SAD.  Living in Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time. I did not use it on weekends. --- Anyway, I think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that helped the most. --- I will indeed use the light again this winter, because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me	pos
I purchased this item recently at a local Radio Shack because it was on sale for $7.99.  In my case, I did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered, but I did get a disappointing one.  I use an older CD writer (NEC NR-7800A) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16X, and I have achieved that speed with other media (notably Imation).  In my system, however, these Sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8X no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used.  Either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive.  On the positive side, all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my DVD-ROM drive, DVD player, and CD player. ---  --- There's no point in buying this Sony product when there are so many others out there.  Find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it. ---  --- UPDATE:  The current model number on Sony's web site for the 50-pack CD-R spindle is 50CDQ80LS3 (not 50CDQ80LS2).  If you still want to buy Sony, try to find the current model number	neg
I had to read this book as part of a Masters-Level class on organizational management. I would offer it up for sale, but I intend to burn it when class is over.  Unless you want to read a book written by people who are SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU ARE (he said with an extra helping of sarcasm), do yourself a favor and skip this book.  It a bunch of religous, self-righteous, fairy tale dogma.  Horrible, horrible book.  Will look nice when it's burnt to a crisp, however	neg
I just transformed it for the first time into a truck. It was challenging but doable. Probably one of the coolest toys ever, but I was an 80's child. As someone else mentioned, the grill in front does not quite align with the cab windows when it's all set, but other than that it's great. Tremendous amount of detail (moveable leg vents, head, mouth, individual fingers/thumb poseable, light behind Matrix, datacom interface, working shocks on the wheels, and accessories). It's quite tall and heavy for a toy- very impressive. If a piece snaps off from forcing it the wrong way, it is designed to snap back on. I never got to own a Transformer as a teen but my lost childhood is now officially redeemed. This will adorn my office cube as a conversation piece	pos
Well, I originally ordered the Black UTG Black Sniper Rifle, but was out of stock at Air-Splat. Well, I could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the Green UTG OD Green Sniper Rifle that I had been thinking about ahead of time. So I sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later. The screws, you get some screws, now on the newer versions, the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger, is not the long screw. You put in a short screw, well at least for me. I had tried to figure out what was wrong, finally decided to call them and they told me what to do. --- Now to the Gun- Excelent. Definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper. Also, have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin. It will either bleed or nice a welt, and if thats cool with you, than by all means dont tell them untill its to late. The gun itself should only be used with .20g and up. Anything less will ruin the gun. With .20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda. The gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed. Personally, I stay back and take head shots at the other team's leaders and medics. With the bolt-action that you use, you can decide when you are going to relode. Also, you should also get alot of white .20g. With white .20g, you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots.  --- Pros: --- Very accurate --- Very painful (could be con, depends on how you look at it) --- Weighted well --- Very intimidating looking  ---  --- Cons: --- A bit heavy for long games (But you should be moving anyways now should you?) --- If you dont sight your scope (or dont even get one) there are no aiming sights, it would be a bit wasy to miss	pos

The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.  ---  --- Though the author's real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US.  ---  --- In the US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut.  ---  --- He especially decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. The theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it.  ---  --- If the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore.  ---  --- It is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment. 	neg
I bought the familiy fun pack ($65) from the ad on TV!  What a mistake!  When it arrived one tub was open and spilled all inside the box while another unopened tub was nearly dried out. No return label or customer service number was enclosed so I couldn't even return it! It is such a mess and smells like chemicals.  It stuck to a votive candle holder ok and it looks kind of cute but when you try to just mold it all it does is stick to EVERYTHING including your hands.  Some are really gooey like slimy paint while other tubs are nearly dry and you end up with micro-mini styrofoam beads all over the place and they sink down into the carpeting and won't come out.  Needless to say, it sat around for awhile until it finally made it's way to it's new home....the trash	neg

Castlevania: Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die-hard Castlevania fan might not much get into. Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great. And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems. Sometimes scary problems. Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so. But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow. ---  --- Ever since the 1997 all time best, Symphony of the Night, so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way. Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception. He looks a little like Alucard. ---  --- But we're not here to discuss that. Hector is a Devil Forgemaster, one who has given up his powers. Dracula is dead, but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of Valachia. Hector, however, isn't concerned about what kind of shape the world is in. He's more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac, who has killed his beloved. If you couldn't guess, it's time for revenge. And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome. And by doing so, Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot. The story actually unfolds with excellent voice-acting, but there isn't much story. ---  --- Since Symphony of the Night we've been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania. This is marvelous, and once again, makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania. You explore a large castle riddled with goodies. This includes weapons, subweapons, armor and much more. ---  --- Playing the game can be quite fun. Most of the game, as you might have guessed, is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters. That isn't as boring as you might think. You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies, but each one must be finished with the B button. You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos. This makes the camera go crazy, though, but this is forgiveable. Battling without locking on is actually much better, and it isn't too hard to do without. Although, if you want to steal from your enemies, you'll have to lcok on to 'em. Speaking of stealing, it's nice that you can actually do that. Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing. This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage. Again, you must be locked on for it to happen. ---  --- Likewise, unlike Lament of Innocence, they actually use the level up system. In other words, there's actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time. ---  --- You also have little helper monsters. You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games (like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror), but the better comparison would be Pokemon. They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies, just as you do. It's nice not to have to go at it alone, but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone. Each enemy also drops evolution crystals. Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve. You won't grow to like them, though. That's the sad part, and they don't really enhance the gameplay. The monsters have special abilities, though. Golem like creatures can open heavy doors, imps let you bury underground. But you can't help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters. Also, no evolution crystal is the same. You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve. ---  --- One of the nice things about being a devil forger, you can make your own weapons! And Hector can do it at any time he wants! That's right, no running back to some stupid shop to do it! Monsters often drop raw materials, and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger. You can do this simply by opening the menu. I don't know about you, but that's pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that. ---  --- The weapons have their own little downside however. With the exception of the sword, none of them are highly helpful in combat. You start the game off with a short sword, and you'll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use. Other weapons just aren't fast enough, and enemies aren't weak to a certain weapon "type". This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points. Unless you're a person who likes to use "cool" looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons, you won't have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system, except to power up your sword. Thus, experimenting with weapons garners no fun. ---  --- It is pretty cool, I must say, to be venturing somewhere that isn't Dracula's castle. Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia. Meaning you'll trek through swamps, mountains, valleys and a lot more. So if you're tired of Dracula's castle, this is quite a change. ---  --- The problem with this "world" is that you don't see enough of it. There's not enough detail to it. You have to follow a beaten path (so it isn't really that different than Dracula's castle in Lament of Innocence), so you can't go off and just explore the places you're at. The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from: the lack of detailed enviroments. You'll no doubt run down the same path/hall/corridor several times over. If it weren't for the map you'd find yourself lost, thinking you must be in one of those "looping" ares, or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle. ---  --- The monsters are also not so great. What I love about the 2D Castlevania games (especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow) is how much variety is thrown into the monsters. The attacks they use on you. Even if they're the same looking monster, they throw in some new attack that you don't expect. Curse of Darkness (like Lament of Innocence) has no variety. You'll run into the same batch of monsters constantly, and they'll never do something new. Later in the game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new. Likewise, all the monsters you'll ever see are encountered pretty early on. The moment you run into an Axe Armor, you've run into 'em all! They'll never change. ---  --- I sound like I'm being picky about the enemies thing, but I'm not. It takes away from the challenge of the game. The fact that reincarnates don't do anything new makes it more true. And that's not the worst part: the game overall just isn't a challenge. The bosses can be, at times, but if you've been playing 3D action games, I think you'll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all. The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy. Later on, however, they get start to get hard, and that's when battling them actually becomes fun. Again, though, if you're an action/adventure pro, you'll probably beat most of them on your first try. ---  --- I wish I could say the graphics are great. Hey, Hector looks great in combat. But the enviroments don't have enough detail. Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we've been seeing for a long time now. Where's the detail? You know... like... maybe the leaves on a tree moving? We're at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment, instead of it seeming like we're running through a still-life painting. Visually, it doesn't look half bad. It's just that there could be so much more. The bosses look cool, and the framerate doesn't slow down at all, but there isn't enough variety, or detail. ---  --- However, I must say this: the music sounds AWESEOME! As usual, the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming! Is it better than Symphony of the Night? No, it's not. It isn't better than Lament of Innocence either (which also had steller music), but it is still among the best you'll ever hear in a video game. Likewise, the voice acting is actually really really GOOD! I just wish I could've heard more of it! ---  --- Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game. But there are a lot of things that keep it down. It's a fairly fun game to play, but it lacks innovation. You won't be able to separate it from the other action/adventure 3D games. It's got nothing that makes it stick out. ---  --- If you MUST have this game, however, I'd say wait for a price drop. If you're really looking for a good Castlevania game, I'd suggest getting a hold of "Dawn of Sorrow". It's a much better game. ---  --- The Good: --- +Great Music! Some of the best in gaming! --- +Good weapon system --- +It's pretty fun to play --- +You can steal from enemies! --- +Great Voice acting! ---  --- The Bad --- -Little innovation --- -Lack of cutscenes to advance the story --- -Too much of the game gets recycled too fast --- -Too easy --- -The game doesn't look bad, but there's little imagination in the environments --- -Not a whole lot of different enemies --- -It's too easy --- -Boring level designs (not enough of them) --- -You just can't help that the game has almost no innovation! It's no different than your average action/adventure 3D game ---  --- Get Dawn of Sorrow, or one of the other 2D versions of the game. They seem to fare so much better than this one does. Even the die-hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland	pos

Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set.	neg
Unfortunately you are correct - these are not the same Premium Heavyweight Cloth Diapers that used to come from Gerber.  When I called the company (I use these cloth diapers in my business) to ask, they told me this was the same product.  It is not.

Having read reviews that the fluorescent bulb was dim, I was careful to purchase the LED model.  However, it is also dim.  Barely produces enough light to keep me from tripping in my shed, not enough to distinguish tools and definitely not a work light.  Very disappointing.  After several days of charging I turned it on and only 4 of the 5 LEDs lit.  I did not purchase from Amazon.  Went in round and round discussions with retailer and manufacturer about warranty replacement.  Retailer would only replace if whole unit returned within 30 days, but after all the trouble to mount solar panel on roof I didn't want to take that down.  Turns out there is no warranty.  Product guide says to consult retailer for warranty service, retailer says they don't do it.  Finally got a replacement but was not refunded shipping and insurance.  If you do purchase this product, my advice is to charge it up before mounting anything to test it	neg

Just wanted to quickly say I haven't finished it yet, I am only on page 20  but already this book seems very overrated. The author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness, but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views. Instead, he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate, conclusive authority on spirituality, and it's very aloof and, actually, not an enlightened approach at all! I've just started the chapter on Karma and it's really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people's opinions clothed as quasi-originality. It looks like I'm going to continue reading with a very cautious, vetting attitude toward the text. The fact that this was a bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people are to develop their spiritual consciousness - and how easily authors such as Zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears. Hey, that's the material world for you!	neg
Givenchy's Very Irresistible is magnificent!  Floral, yet spicy overtones with a touch of black current in a rose peony base.  Better than Bob Mackie's "Perhaps" perfume.

This perfume is different than the typical scents that arrive on the market and well worth a try! 	pos

This is an excellent little grill for home or the road. The lid lock is a godsend and the side benefit is that due to the construction of the piece, smokey joe is an apt name. the carry handle is awesome. The side vents direct air such that I almost always have beautiful smoke filling my little grill and infusing my meal with fabulous flavor. I've had mine for over a decade and while I've gone through another big Weber kettle and now a huge smoker, this little number is still in the race and I have NO intentions of giving it up. I'm taking it camping with me next weekend. It's a no-brainer. Buy it and be happy	pos

I was a bit disappointed in this tape.  The workouts are too easy.  I had mastered  --- Abs of Steel I and was looking for Abs of Steel 2.  I couldn't find it so I bought this one but its too easy.  I found a used Abs of Steel 2 and I like it much better	neg
I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video "easy to master".  I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.  I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing	neg
The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story.	neg
I've only used my rack for cooking chickens, but I'm looking forward to doing a turkey soon. I've never sprayed the rack with non-stick cooking spray, there's no need to. Everything comes off, and it cleans up beautifully in the dishwasher. I like the fact that I can put the chicken on the rack way before I put it on the grill - the rack makes it easy to get the chicken back into the house, too. I typically put the rack and cooked chicken on a cookie sheet, and carve the chicken right on the rack. Well made, tons of uses, yet inexpensive. Does it get any better	pos

This is an important and well presented video tape documentary on the Panama Canal. It is also about how the United States was instrumental in the following: assisting Panama independence from Colombia, completing the canal project where the French failed, establishing U.S. geopolitical interests in Panama, e.g., military bases and improving trade relations throughout the world by the Panama Canal transit waterway	pos
My objection was the implication that the "stars" played a part in the film.  I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer.  It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary	neg
This book was on a very interseting topic. The author took time in studying this topic. It was about the impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. The author was ver knowledgable and I could tell he knew what he was talking about. ---  --- I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage. I say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring. When you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring. I gave it a low rating because I have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book	neg

My little boy is a certified dino-phile, to the point where he's had to teach me to pronounce several dinosaur names (ever tried saying Edmontonsaurus three times fast?). But, like any kid, his favorite remains the T-Rex, tyrant lizard king. ---  --- When it comes to his numerous dinosaur toys, this is the most durable by far. Although we've had the same problems getting this to stand at times, as mentioned by another reviewer, that hasn't diminished my son's enjoyment. ---  --- To top it off, he's come up with fun new uses for the toy, too. That catapult is VERY good at aiming at our family cat, much to my son's delight	pos

A couple of years ago, we completed the transition over to the Mac platform in our household.  Both my wife and myself have a desktop and a laptop, so leveraging the .Mac service to keep our personal configuration settings synchronized across computers has been fantastic.  Further, with the sharing features that are available, we each have access to view the other person's address book or calendar.   ---  --- One of the great features of the .Mac service is how it is tightly integrated into the operating system.  In addition, since the Synch Services capabilities in the operating system are documented and open, third party programs can write plug-ins that can leverage .Mac to propagate settings to different machines. ---  --- My favorite feature (and the catalyst for my initial subscription) is the Backup application.  As someone who has suffered the inconvenience of crashed hard disk drives far too many times, I wanted a simple, comprehensive, easy-to-use solution that I could use to backup my data to an external hard disk drive on a daily basis.  I've used other Mac-specific programs before and none are as easy to use as the Backup you get with .Mac. ---  --- The only real critique I have for the .Mac service is the amount of space available on the iDisk.  When services like Google Mail can offer 2.7GB of space for free (granted it is supported by advertising), it makes the .Mac the space available with .Mac seem meager.  Of course, considering a full backup of my data/settings takes up about 8GB of space, I may be outside of the demographic that the .Mac service is targeting.  However, in this age of digital media (pictures and movies), the amount of disk space people need for their "memories" is only going to go up. ---  --- But I guess that is why they have external drives and DVD burners	pos
This toy is a piece of junk. I can't believe Disney actually did any testing whatsoever on this toy. An adult can't even get it to work. The car is supposed to sense the infrared light in front of it and follow, but all it does is jerk forward a teeny bit and then stop. If anything, it senses when the light clicks off and then it jerks forward a little bit. We read the instructions and saw that the car does not work well in bright lighting conditions so we took it down to the dark basement (as if my son should actually be expected to only play with this car in the dark!) but it didn't even work there.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT on Christmas morning that we had to wait 8 hours for it charge, and then even BIGGER disappointment the next morning when we finally got to play with it and it didn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY	neg

I bought this tea from a dot-head store.  I'm usually a decaf coffee drinker, but when ill I make this.

Man this game sucks.  I LOVE SNL, but the questions here are SO trivial.  I was looking forward to getting this for Christmas and was very excited when I opened it.  It all went downhill from there.  I think the pieces are a good idea, but they're ugly.  The DVD clues are dumb and ineffective.  I was playing with my dad (who is legally blind).  He couldn't read the questions on the tv.  I think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated.  Overall, the game sucked, the questions were silly and it wasn't fun at all!  As an aside, I noticed that there are no African Americans on the box or the board.  One could argue that Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock were more successful SNL stars than, say, Cheri Oteri.  Whatever.  Game sucks.  Costs too much.  Stay away	neg

I've been wearing Philosophy's Falling in Love as a regular fragrance and liked it so much that I decided to give some of their other products a try... Pure Grace has been a lovely find! I spray a little on a blouse or jacket and have that lovely fresh-washed scent lingering all day. It compliments the Falling in Love scent nicely, as both are fairly light, but I love it on its own as a nice change of pace as well. So far it has been just as advertised-- clean, soapy and crisp-- and I'd add that it's just one of the most comforting smells around... makes me want to curl up in a pile of warm towels fresh from the dryer and take a little nap	pos
It feels so strange describing this game to people who have never heard of it before. "Yeah, you play as this tiny little prince, and your father, the King of All Cosmos, got drunk one night and destroyed all the stars in the sky. Your job is to go around the earth with this psychedelic sticky thing called a katamari and roll stuff up into a big ball. Really, that's all you do - just roll as much stuff as possible into a massive ball, and if it's big enough, your gigantic, well-endowed father will shoot it up into the sky to become a new star. And, uh, that's the plot." WTF? ---  --- Yeah, you just gotta play it. And that's the best advice I can give. What exactly is it that attracts me to such a bizarre game? Perhaps it satisfies some strange compulsion of mine to just...roll things up...into a ball. I dunno, it's just plain fun. The controls are very simple - you only use the left and right analog sticks to navigate through your brightly colored, exceedingly cluttered environment. What really adds to the enjoyment of this game is the sound. Every object you pick up lets out a unique sound as it's unapologetically absorbed into your ball of junk, and it's quite amusing. Furthermore, the soundtrack is catchy and upbeat, and you're sure to get the songs stuck in your head for hours (days, weeks, months...lol). I also love the fact that this title is enjoyable and playable for both gamers and non-gamers alike. The controls are quick to pick up, and simple objective is easy to jump into. Truly, this game is just off-the-wall fun, and if you're willing to try something unique with a healthy dose of craziness, give this game a roll	pos

To bring the co-sleeper up to the height of the bed, these leg extensions are the best bet.

(You'll be getting up anyway, so it probably doesn't matter how tall it is.)  But once attached to the bed with the anchor strap, rather than free-standing, it was very secure. 	pos

I was looking forward to a magazine that took a good look at different subjects than those covered in the mainstream media. What I received was a manual on how to think the "right" way. I've never delved deeply into politically labeling myself, but I vaguely considered myself a liberal. Man, was I wrong. Clearly, liberal means much the same as the demonized "conservative". This magazine has a single viewpoint, that of an ultraliberal ex-hippie who has found themselves wealthy in the 21st century. It is full of articles about "finding meaning" and "reassessing life" that seem to have been written by folks who drive Chevy Suburbans and pay too much for a cup of coffee. The magazine gives off a strong smell of covert superiority, and it made me nauseous	neg
"Ha ha ha hah ha hah!"  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense! ---  --- My recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for	neg
What can you say for "Katamari Damcy" except for it's exciting, original, fun, & edgy!.

The samsung A900 Blade is an excellent phone. I can say so many good things about it. The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life. And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint. Nobody wants to charge their phone between 2-4 times a day. With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times. But that's what you get with a razor thin phone. So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial. This battery is a life saver. Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found, and I did extensive searching. Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial. I've seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door. You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery. What would you do, put a rubber band around it? Heck no. Well anyway, now that I have this battery, my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries. My A-900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little. Don't worry, you're phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all it's features without dying	pos

Purchased as a gift to client. The gift basket arrived on time and the recipient commented on how nice the basket was. But one of the cups was chipped. They could not find the chipped piece so we don't know whether or not the break occurred during shipping or not.

Starbucks coffee and mugs are great corporate gifts but I would choose another company to handle the gift baskets. Will not use them again	neg
Justice in the criminal justice system? What is that but empty talk in the real world? IN HELL shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system.

A true portrayal of life in today's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men, and corrupt power brokers who run them.    --- 	pos

I have one word for the Argus Quick Clix, Horrible. I bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for Christmas. The camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them. I was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use. This camera takes horrible pictures. All of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy. When the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject. One very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off. There is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash. You have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use. As stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture, it is so bright that the picture is useless. I would not recommend this camera to anyone	neg
Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this! It's burnt, bitter, weak, battery-acid! And, as consequence, those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill. I don't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for "senseo compatible pods" and you'll find several on the first page. Also, please note that while these may initially seem pricier, most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand. You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe.  ---  --- [...	neg
How could Mr. Cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody? ---  --- The production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos, but the script and dialogue are so banal, the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another.

This Picture hit the theaters back in 1975 when a series of disaster films were made. Steve McQueen plays the role of Fire Chief Michael O'Hallorhan, Paul Newman plays the role of Doug Roberts and William Holden plays the role of James Duncan. Roberts is the architect that built the 138 story skyscraper in the heart of the Golden Gate City San Francisco. So James Duncan the owner of the building decides to throw a party inviting over 300 guest to celebrate it's opening. Things start to go wrong when a **** starts in a hall closet. Roberts gets more concern when he fines out that Duncan son in law Roger Simmons has cut cost by putting cheaper wire.

I saw the show on stage.  I saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this.  Unfortunately, this is Ann Reinking's version of Bob Fosse.  Reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential Fosse dancer of the 70's and 80's created this tribute.  The difference is Ann Reinking has taken the Fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own. ---  --- As a tribute to Fosse this is inaccurate.  Therefore, for Fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works.  Also, there is a too big reliance on his concept musical "Dancin'". ---  --- The one good thing in this is the addition of another Fosse creation Ben Vereen.  He shows why he can still pack a house. ---  --- My suggestion is to rent Fosse films like Sweet Charity and All that Jazz.  You'll get to see the real Fosse	neg
I did not have any of the original trilogy on DVD.  I am happy to have the theatrical releases as I am not a fan of the SE's, particularly Jedi.

If you already happily own the SE's or are feeling cheated or robbed in some way by repeated releases of the same movie, then don't buy these. 	pos

My husband and I were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born.  He has been using it up to now, and I used it this week for the first time.  Our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds.  It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone.

Amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly. We ended up buying the DGX 5.1 MP from a local store i it's place.

I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.

I love this cereal; I eat it every morning with maple syrup or honey, raisins, and walnuts.  It is never pasty for me, as it is for the other reviewer, unless I let it cook way too long or let it sit to cool too long.  I cook it for five minutes, turn off the heat and let it thicken a couple of minutes more as I add my raisins and walnuts and maple syrup.  Then I stir in rice milk until I get it to the consistency I like.  Though I don't like rice milk by itself or on any other cereal, it does taste really good on this rice cereal, with the added benefit of making the whole thing easier to digest.  Rice cereal is the easiest cereal to digest, anyway, but adding rice milk instead of cow's milk makes it even more easier	pos

On page 116, formula 6.1, the price formula for a bond is actually for a semiannual coupon bond, not as stated on the book, for annual coupon bond. --- As a consequence, the dv01, duration and convexity formula it states are for semiannual coupon bonds as well.  --- I think both Tuckman and Fabozzi's books have their own pros and cons. Tuckman's book touchs more on the trading, which is interesting. Although it could be less rigorous in terms of treating the formulas. I own both books.	pos

I know I'm a little late, but what the heck? I felt like writing a review for this game. Final Fantasy X is just a fantastic game. Simple as that. Its extremely deep, has a fantastic story, great characters, great battle system, and it's the perfect length for a RPG (45-55 hours). Not everyone likes Tidus, be he honestly doesn't bother me, and I think he is a interesting character. The rest of the cast is well developed, and they all have interesting personalities that are distinct to this universe. The cast is very memorable, you'll remember them for years to come, and I think that speaks volumes as to how good this game is. Its enhanced by the usual good voice acting that Square is known for, so that doesn't disapoint. ---  --- The gameplay is extremely fun, and its actually one of my favorite battle systems. The battle system can make or break a RPG, and this one doesn't disappoint. Its fast paced, so it doesn't get bogged down by long battles. You can also swap characters mid battle, thats a awesome feature. The gameplay is also incredibly deep, I've heard of people literally pouring hundreds of hours into this game. So if thats your thing, I'm sure you've probably already played this game. If for some reason you have not played this game and your into RPG's, don't hesitate to pick this game up, its cheap now, and its one of the best and most balanced RPG's I've ever played	pos
We haven't had any problems cleaning this chair--occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum, but that is simple enough.  Most of the time, we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides.  (We'd do that with any high chair.) The tray doesn't fit in our dishwasher, but that too has been easy to clean in the sink.   ---  --- We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl.  Our daughter is very happy in her chair.  She is only 16 months, but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all.   ---  --- Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out.  that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw--we just live with it since it isn't that big a deal. 	pos

My old Grill was well over-due for replacement, and so I started doing some research into a replacement. My previous grill was a Coleman, and had lasted a good 10 years, although the cooking quality had definately deteriorated. ---  --- I was going to purchase another "cheapy" grill, but in my research, I noticed something - almost every Weber owner rated their grill 5-star, whereas the cheapies usually mustered three stars at best. ---  --- A little more research quickly pointed out why - Webers may not last any longer than the cheaper competitors, but a 10-year old Weber still cooks better than the cheap ones do when brand new. ---  --- I invested in the "Platinum C". but have yet to use the side-burner, so I'm not sure how valuable that is. I was delighted with the quality of the Grill - it was easy to assemble, and the cooking quality is - fantastic. I purchased a Weber Griddle, and I also have a Pizza stone, and with these two additions, I cooked 8 meals in a row on my Weber, including Bacon and Eggs, home-made bread, pizza, and of course, grilled steak	pos

I have not heard of or listened to, this cd series, but from the sound of it, its all bad interpretations of popular music.  I just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff... play classical music.  Play stuff without lyrics.  Play a show on tv where the characters sing.  Do anything but, buy a cd where people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place.  Censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song.  There are just some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words.  Think about this... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song?  Listen... I'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible, but cds like this are not the way to go.  All they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff, they're gonna be asking questions.  Do them and yourself a favor and don't buy these cds	neg
This CD is a must for anyone who enjoys great guitar music. Its packed full of amazing pieces and inspiring playing. My favorite track is Isn't it Romantic because it successfully makes a classic out of this song. BUY IT NOW!!	pos
This book captures the human spirit, at both its best and its worst.  Schwarz-Bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of Ernie Levy, from birth and on.  He also, shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the Nazi movement.  It is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the Jewish people.  It is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a Just Man, although without them humanity would crumble, as future readers will find out their importance.  And if there really are Just Men in our world...we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders	pos
This story is so fascinating that I couldn't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer, Arenas, to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in Cuba under Castro.

This product is ineffective.  ---  --- The snorkel gets stuck, either open so that water pours in while you're trying to breathe, or stuck shut so you cannot take a breath of air while under water. It's is very distressing when you're out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform! I often take in mouthfuls of water, or worse; suck for a breath of air and get nothing! It is therefore useless, I stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good. ---  --- I bought two sets, one for my partner and one for myself, and they both fail to perform. The mask on one set broke after 2 months (the metal pin became dislodged) and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet. The bag's zippers rusted not long after use... given that most people snorkel in salt water, you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal.  ---  --- Overall the quality of these not-so-cheap kits are embarrassingly bad. We both felt awkward snorkeling with them, and sometimes I even felt they were hazardous.  ---  --- We tossed these products and bought Cressi brand gear. It has changed our underwater experience	neg
I'm very happy with this case.  I was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my Treo 700p, but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it.

After assembling a Dora's Talking Cash Register that scans the wrong items, a Dora's talking backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored this Christmas!  This toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect.  Plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker.  My daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in the walker. So what if it doesn't!  It will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on.  I would recommend this toy- very cute and fun! 	pos
I've worked out with Cathe for about 6 months now, and I have to say, this is one of my favorite workouts.  It combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout.   ---  --- The cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump, do Power 15's, fast feet shuffles, spike lunges, etc.  Lower body work - well, let's just say, I hope you like to do leg press- since you'll be doing it  - A LOT.  There are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg.  Also, Cathe inserts some static lunges and squats, among other moves.  She does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn, there!  Arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work, such as tricep dips off the high step, push ups, bicep curls, overhead extension, etc. ---  --- Overall, if you're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles, this is the workout for you.  Beginners, beware- you can modify certain exercises (I use dumbbells instead of a barbell) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser	pos

Hard, smart, creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days.  Even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us, finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch. ---  --- Thankfully, "Secrets," under the usually readily available  Columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $9.99.  Should this be a hard decision? Emphatically: No. ---  --- Although I can see where previous reviewers are coming from, trying to compare this outing to Headhunters is truly unnecessary.  With this '76 effort Herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz, funk and disco but it all works.  "Doin It" is a super, super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the "Man-Child" sessions.  And although "Gentle Thoughts" can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album.  It's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and, as always,  Herbie dancing on the keys.  ---  --- Go get "Secrets," don't think about it.  It'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion	pos

I am a personal trainer and I was asked by a friend to check this "elliptical" strider out for them.  I was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway.   --- As I suspected, this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago. Except for the Tony Little TV glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone. There is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are NO gliders in health clubs. With ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running.  This of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past. Also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion.  --- I've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing.  But it is a question of time.  You could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical.  I'm not promoting any one brand and I have no ax to grind, except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like Sharper Image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products. The reason elliptical machines are called "elliptical" is that the user's foot goes through an elliptical path.  Gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum.  If you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist.  This is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals.  My advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical.  --- 	neg
Though I still encounter products not worth the time to laugh at, I have noticed more and more products coming to market that actually meet and sometimes beat expectations.  ---  --- Well, the Mr. Clean AutoDry Met expectations, though it does have a couple flaws. ---  --- I've owned this product since it first hit the store shelves, after a very hyped up Television marketing deal... I figured that if I bought it at Target and it does not work to my satisfaction, Target will give me my money back. I tried it, and it worked perfectlly. I knew from prior experience that de-ionised water will not leave spots as it is the ions of molecules in the water that are left behind when the water molecules evaporate. Remove those ions and there is nothing to be left behind. I was a little sceptical that such a small filter would work well, however, but for the most part, it has worked acceptably, but as the unit has some flaws, I should list them... ---  --- Flaw 1) The soap filler cap was badly designed. If there is any soap left in the unit when you store it, you have to be sure to store it so that the cap is upright (it is on the units side, not the top), else you will find a puddle of congealed, semi-dry soap when you pull it off the shelf a week later! There is no work around for this except to remember to store the unit upright, or lay on the other side. ---  --- Flaw 2) lack of a trigger for flow control. The unit uses a VERY peculiar flip switch which is a little difficult to flip on and off easily. It's not terrible, but a trigger like a garden sprayer would be SO much better! ---  --- Flaw 3) The hose connector does not turn freely... As you walk around the car, the hose twists and the water pressure tries to twist it back... This might be limited to the unit I purchased, but either way, it has been quite annoying. I found a perfect work around for this, though it did cost me a few extra dollars. I bought a hose quick disconnect that spins quite freely. it was a little expensive ($6, but works better than any other I have ever tried, and I simple screwed one end onto the autodry and the other onto the hose, and got some extra sprayer connectors ($4 each) for the other spray heads I use, and it's all good. ---  --- Other than the above three flaws, I am quite pleased with this product, and use it routinely. I can wash my car in about 30 minutes, and I am quite particular... ---  --- Here is the procedure I follow: ---  --- 1) I quickly rinse down the whole car to get any dirt wet. --- 2) I then spray a section of the car, usually starting with the roof, with the soap --- 3) using a super soft, laundered wool wash mitt, I gently "scrub" the soaped area, and quickly rinse with unfiltered water, and ensure that the entire car remains wet. --- 4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for other parts of the car (i.e. hood, trunk, sides, etc.), --- 5) Using the filtered water, starting from the high points of the car (i.e. roof) and working down to the sills, I completely rinse off the whole car and then let it dry, sun or shade. I've never had any spots whatsoever, except when the filter turns brown (which indicates the filter is exhausted)	pos

I had never read any of  Vernor Vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so I thought I would try this.  Boy, am I glad I bought it used on Amazon for about only $4.  I simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. The plot is unintelligible. I dont know what the Bioweapon  the jacket refers to is? I dont know what "the Rabbit" is.  I see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. I do not understand how someone could write so incoherently.  --- The concept of someone who had Alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere.

I changed this review from when I first wrote it a couple of weeks ago.  When I first wrote it, the title was "I like it".  Now I've changed it to "I love it!!!" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again.  This mascara will NOT smudge!  It will not leave "racoon eyes" under your lash line.  It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes.  I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles.  I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued.  When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away.  As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it.  It makes your lashes look really long!  They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct.  This mascara doesn't "fatten" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using.  I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water.  It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara.  It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little "Purity Made Simple" cleanser on it.  I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again.  Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind	pos

I'm sure most people will come to Fitzgerald through her novels, so I have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories.  I still haven't decided if I enjoyed the collection, but they are unique.  I thought the first story was by far the best, but after that, the quality varied widely.  Unlike a classic short story writer (someone like Guy de Mauppassant), these stories have NO resolution for the most part.  In fact, they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the  major key.  Discordant is the word I'm looking for.  The settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries.  I suspect most would enjoy her novels more (I am certainly heading in that direction to read them next), but I can't say since I haven't read them myself.  Overall, I found this collection a bit unsettling, but still well written.  I'm sure her fans will enjoy them more than I did on this first encounter	pos

SPOILER ALERT ---  ---  --- The ending of this 118-minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion. The bored billionaire did it. However, he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very, very hot. Pierce Brosnan, the billionaire, still sexist from his stint as James Bond, enjoys playing with the lady, Renee Russo. And she, as the tough but sexy Catherine Olds Banning, loses her heart to him, as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed. In the process, she shows some very appealing nipples.  ---  --- The 1968 version, of which this is a remake, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In this version, to the socially irresponsible, self-absorbed 90s are ever present. We don't mind not having the suspense, we just yearn to see Brosnan and Russo "get it on." Dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible. ---  --- Brosnan, as Thomas Crown, is bored, but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman, for as long as he is interested in her. For thrills, he steals priceless works of art from publicly-funded museums. The film makes it clear he can do so, under the noses of   security guards, police, and hundreds of innocent art-lovers. Russo's insurance company insured the painting, so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable, but impossible to fence Monet, and save her employer a bundle.  ---  --- What we have here is a film with clever dialog, rich and exotic sets, and loads of sexual tension. One wonders now, after Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other corporate heists, just whom Brosnan is cheating in order to support his high-tech heist brigade. How many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this. He never really, you know, works. But I digress. ---  --- Dennis Leary has a character role as the streetwise New York detective, who advises Russo's Banning. As we watch her slowly spiral out of control, risking her job and her reputation, we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether Russo will fall for him, or Brosnan. Duh. ---  --- The film moves back and forth from caper to cover-up. This can be confusing, but who cares? All we have to do is wait for their next move, the next gorgeous set, the next revealing love scene. ---  --- The Thomas Crown Affair will keep both men and women interested, for all the usual reasons. ---  --- It is a film worth watching, and a great date flick	pos

I received one of these meals after Hurricane Rita. They were being handed out by first responders to people in the area before our utilities were restored. Excellent product. I wanted more so I could stock up in case of another disaster or emergency. I found their website and discovered that they were not for sale over the internet. I was very disappointed...until today. I went back to their website and saw that the meals are now available from amazon! This is great news! I suggest that everyone stock up on these meals in case of emergencies. They really come in handy.	pos
 --- This works fairly well for me.  It easily downloads the capital gains from Microsoft Money, the interviews are fairly straightforward.  However there are a few areas (like foreign tax credit) where it should be automated but isn't.  But on the whole it does a nice job, they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item. --- 	pos

many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece. --- It is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album.  --- Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.	neg
I bought this set for my three children 5,4,2 last Christmas at a fancy toy store.  This product is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this.  The marble runs are easy to build, sturdy and so much for them to play with.  There are a variety to build with the more advanced sets also we bought a few more "fun" and cool looking marbles as they raced them down.  The kids can change out the different blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a creative aspect.  I LOVE THIS TOY!!!!  My kids beg me to make them a new marble run all the time.  You do need a hard surface to build on, since we didn't have a "train table" we put it on a hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet, that way you don't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit the bottom..	pos
I did not buy this from Amazon but sought it out here so I could vent about this outrageous product (that's 'outrageous' in its traditional meaning, that it outrages me). ---  --- This is two packets of colored dust, approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster.  Empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere, mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart.  My wife and I repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not. ---  --- The claim on the package is that it "Molds like Dough," obviously intended to remind us of Play-doh, but Play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can, in fact, be molded.  This material -- again attempting to compare itself to Play-doh -- states that it won't dry out.  Of course not!  It's dust!  It can't dry out, there's nothing drier than dust. ---  --- In case you're wondering I have no connection to Play-doh or its makers (I don't even know who does make it), I'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses Play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime.  Wrong	neg
I bought some less than a week ago. I've been using it over my brows, between my eyes and under my eyes (although the directions say not to).

I'd definately buy it again	pos
M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema.  However, the mere use of misdirection does not guarantee that a film will wind up being any good.       ---  --- Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) returns home one evening after receiving an award for his work with children.  A former patient awaits him there and shoots him in front of his wife.  Time passes and Crowe tries to put the incident behind him by immersing himself in a new case.  Crowe takes on a new patient named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who claims that he is able to see dead people around him.   ---  --- "The Sixth Sense" created a sensation upon its release as filmgoers relished its twist ending.  Yet, if the truth be told, the ending will not come as a surprise to fantasy and science-fiction fans or to those who are actually paying attention to the events unfolding onscreen rather than sitting back and just going along for the ride.  The entire success of "The Sixth Sense" hinges on whether you are able to figure out the ending ahead of time and unfortunately Shyamalan's use of misdirection just does not mask the final revelation effectively enough.  From the beginning of the film, one knows that something is amiss and the twist becomes more and more obvious as the story continues to unfold.  The acting is first rate with Willis, Osment, Toni Collette, and Olivia Williams turning in great work.  Willis in particular turns in an interesting performance that is a departure from his more action-oriented roles.  However, even with all the quality acting on display, you just cannot shake the feeling that the "The Sixth Sense" is essentially just a drawn-out "Twilight Zone" episode when all is said and done	neg
I bought this scale for my wife (ya, I'm that sort of guy)! She's definitely not heavy, but 'concerned' and a follower of Weight Watchers. I was shocked to read various scale reviews prior to purchasing this one and find so many that did not weigh accurately! Well, this one was highly rated by most reviewers for accuracy & they are right. This scale is very accurate in determing a person's mass (sorry, I was a Physics major too) and confirmed at her Weight Watchers' weighings. As for it's accurate determination of "body fat" and "water", I can't say, but feel these are a bit gimicry anyway. ---  --- As for my wife, she loves the scale & me. Although, her love for me covers over many poorly chosen gifts, so I'm not absolutely sure about her love for the scale. However, I do know she uses it ever day and enjoys telling me of her victories	pos

my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid. there's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar. i really like that it's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar. it's great for those who don't want a flowery bath, but who can't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar. i wish i'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies. plus, this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb. really probably any bomb would do. good stuff	pos

I purchased these so I wouldn't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat.  However, they didn't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws.  Additionally, after only a few classes, the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws, particularly on the foot paws.  I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn't ever have sweaty palms and who doesn't do any intense postures.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing what I do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat	neg

This cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste.  The dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter.  We don't care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either.  The chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors, but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa "tasted strange".  There are many non-gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother, more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand.  We won't buy this cocoa again.  This gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets. But the cocoa fails the taste test.  	neg

I'm in the midst of auditioning LCD panels and the local ISF certified guy wants $350 per panel to calibrate them. I like TV and everything, but there's just no way that I am going to spend $350 on TV that I might possibly keep.  ---  --- Still, the store settings on any two panels have two problems. First, they are amped up beyond compare as the TV vendors compete to be "who's the brightest" on the lit showroom floor. Sitting in my living room, they are far far too bright to watch. Second, they display colors totally differently. It's just hard to compare to 2 sets that are calibrated so differently. ---  --- Now the TVs that we are looking at cost a pretty penny, and it seemed that a couple of hundred dollars to inform the decision was a good idea, just like the hundred dollars for an HDMI splitter seemed like a good idea. The splitter was a good idea, the Spyder TV Colormeter not so much. ---  --- I calibrated 2 panels with this product. Two things are true about the calibrations. First, they do not look at all the same. The Sony panel has red shifted flesh tones while the Sharp looks cold and sterile. Second, they look way way worse than before the calibration. After 20 minutes of watching Casino Royale, it was time to revert back to a toned down version of the factory defaults for each. ---  --- At first I thought that I had not followed the instructions right. Maybe it was not dark enough. Maybe the sensor was not positioned right. Having done the process several times, I can state categorically that while the colorvision Spyder TV may not deliver good results, it is consistent in its delivery of bad results.  ---  --- I simply cannot recommend this product	neg

I am an active 48 year old and I own a Vurtego Pro Pogo stick. I ride motocross and I mountain bike regulary and I like the exercise and fun factor it offers. I chose the Vurtego Pro after doing some online research and I am totally pleased with the performance. The guys who designed and developed the Vurtego Pro and Fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but still high quality stick. The Power model came up short of their extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality and safety concerns.  For the money the Power Pogo is a fairly decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider. It takes allot of effort and experience to go 6' or higher on any pogo stick. I am pretty good at mine, after about a month of use I am getting up in the 3' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a session before taking a break and going for another session or two, a great workout! I have pogo stick experience and can pull off most of the basic tricks, I consider myself a beginner to intermediate at the most. I doubt that I will ever reach the six foot level at my age, but that was never my goal. I know that the people at Vurtego are still working to develope a model that will be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable, high quality and durable stick. If your looking to go 6' and pull off serious stunts I would buy the orignal Vurtego Pro or the Fit model for a great workout. If you are looking for a little less I would wait for the next version that the  Vurtego people will offer and endorse. I personally would avoid this one.  	neg
I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters. ---  --- A newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. Unfortunately TIME fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove TIME's initial position correct. The immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--"we told you so, we told you so." Even worse, the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. Can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? Out of sight, out of mind is the mantra... ---  --- In fact, I sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing, television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic, even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. We seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis. ---  --- Neutrality is dead. Frankly, I don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as I do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. TIME used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the United States--no more. Iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. African states are making vast strides towards democracy, we get an article about Nigerian computer fraud. Russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy, but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in Iraq. Japan, one of the world's most influential cultures, in the week I originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. Somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which TIME could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership, instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of Joel Stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. But most damning is the fact that after reading TIME one asks: How in the hell did our world become boring? ---  --- Can TIME try emulating The Economist rather than The Enquirer? Someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. TIME has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine, if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news	neg

I bought these adaptors to use regular head phones (3mm) with my cell phone mp-3 (LG cu500) player.  Once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound. you only can hear the music through one ear.  Whoever started the whole 2.5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail.  It makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone.  I have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level.  They all have some type of flaw, the volume won't get loud enough, cord to short, poor sound, etc.	neg
The Key to My Heart lipgloss chain is a very cute, original idea, but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the Hard Candy name. The reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. All very true. I got my keychain in the Pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and I was feeling pretty cool about it. However, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it.  ---  --- Now, I've always been a fairly careful person, I'm not klutzy nor do I drop or lose things. My keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, I never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. The first time I was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, I only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because I saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo.  ---  --- How did it come apart like this? I honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. I can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. It was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. This is not the way to go for gloss on your keys	neg

I usually love The First Years products.  I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it.  I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one.  I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one.  Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one.  Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair.  You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide.  At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure.  Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray.  The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down.  You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level.  And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model.  Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat. 	neg
 This book doesn't even deserve a star. I just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. I'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, I don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... I've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry I don't see it! ---  --- Anyone can write a bunch of sex stories. I didn't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain. As for sensual and arousing? Hardly. It was crude, and vulgar. It was sex, sex, sex... and presented harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring, repetitive, and I'll admit disturbing. ---  --- What was the point of the story where the Hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children? Or the raped little boy? It was just weird. There's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be trying to make. It's kind of just left there...unfinished... unsatisfying. Frankly, it was so distasteful (VULGAR), I was shocked. And I'm not religious, puritan, conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite, I have an open mind. But this book left me cold	neg

The cream is great. It instantly gets absorbed  after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries (which causes black circle appearences).

I placed my order with little time to spare before Valentine's Day. Amazon delivered the item is a timely fashion as usual!! However, to my disappointment, when I opened the box the item came in... it looked TERRIBLE. I though the price was a steal, but feel as if I paid way too much for what was received.  ---  --- I would not recommend purchasing the item unless you intend to give it to someone who doesn't understand jewelry. Give it to someone for their 10th birthday and you'll find at least 1 smile in the room.  ---  --- I have all intentions on returning this item for a refund as I'd feel a little embarrassed giving this as Valentine's Day gift (unless it was for my grandmother).  	neg
I've been a fan of Dave's sauces for quite awhile now and this product is no exception.  The initial bite into one of these olives is relatively painless.  And then the fun begins.  A slow burning sensation begins to take over until your mouth is wondering, "what did I just do?".  Want some more fun?  Offer some to friends and then stand back to watch the excitement.  While not as heat intensive as his Insanity Sauces, ranking only half-way up his thermometer scale, it's still got a little bit of punch to it with it's five different peppers.  Who would've though olives could be this much fun	pos
This may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch.  It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy.  Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are. ---  --- The timepiece:  Outstanding.  It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues.  This should go without saying in a modern digital watch.  Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested).  Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set).  Three daily alarms.  Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this. ---  --- The Altimeter:  largely eye candy, but kind of neat.  Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL).  Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it. ---  --- The Barometer:  Yup, it's a barometer.  The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode). ---  --- The Thermometer:  Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist. ---  --- The compass:  Easily the best 'special' feature.  Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use.  It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way.  The sighting notches are small but servicable.  The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass.  An outstanding wrist compass. ---  --- The package:  Big.  Really, really big.  But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches).  The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance.  The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight.  Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great. ---  --- Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter.  Well designed, thought-out, and manufactured, but really big. 	pos

Throughout the years I have used and owned many different versions of the Brita Pitcher Water Dispenser. All of these filtered water containers have been great. The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size. The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products. ---  --- Pro: ---  --- Size: This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (Ironically, this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.) ---  --- Con(s): ---  --- Mold: If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days, you will get mold. This mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). To avoid this problem, the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to safe you should wash it more often). I have never had this problem with Brita's other products (I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months, and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it). ---  --- Left Over Water: Due to the faulty design of the product, there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. Besides turning the product upside down, you cannot dispense all of the water. This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. Not surprisingly, this helps further contribute to mold growth. ---  --- Conclusion: ---  --- Save your money and buy Brita's other well designed pitchers or even Pure's pitchers. (The key word is pitcher.) You will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product	neg

As for "Close Enough to Perfect" if any man sings that song to his lady, she is his forever. The cuteness of "Never Be One" also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it. There isn't a bad song on the whole CD and will make a good addition to any collection	pos

this is pure drivel!!!!!clearly there was some kind of argument behind this film;like the director wasnt given enough money to make it,so he thought,you know what,im going to spite the film company by making a hideousely awful film,that'll show them.the "plot",if i can re-tell it without vomiting,is thus:a plane is struck by lightning,and kills all the pilots..............i kind of lost what was going on after that......the ending,if there actually was one,was that whatever predicament they were in,they got out of.where can i begin?????clearly no one involved with this project has any knowledge of basic physics,as they'd have pointed out that this ISNT POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!im a little bit rusty on my physics,but isnt it called a faraday coil???if not then forgive me,my minds a little indestinct,but the main point is a bolt of lightning wont pass through a plane. "what about the glass,it passed through the glass window!!!" you bark smugly,well thick glass used for this wouldnt allow electric current to pass through it.think about it people,you ever been hit by lightning indoors??have you ever heard of this happening in real life before??NO,BECAUSE IT CANT!!!!!! well done,you're learning.anyway,enough of the banter,the film struggles from then on in.for some bizzare reason the plane operated by a laptop,the cable(??!!) for which has broken.it only works by some guy holding it with venom.factor into this some wierd pregnant woman type nonsense,some shouting passengers/helpful people arguing rubbish,a hint of romance between a "criminal" and a "female human being",and you have this godawful tripe of a film.some wonderfully hilarious moments.guy says "i skipped bail","are you a criminal?" she asks!!!!!! well of course he is you stupid fool,he just told you!!!! any time there was "turbulence" the camera was wobbled about a bit,and the "actors" moved around unconvincingly.the terrible news report segments,where hilarity prevailed every time.the bit when the dog jumped out the car,that was brilliant!!!!he pushed it over a bit then it was half dead...then later he gave the oxygen mask,great!!!!! all the scenes involving the radar room,they were something else!!!!the ending also,the rubbish CGI aeroplane,what a laugh!!!!i could go on and on and on,pointing out rubbish but funny things about this film,but i think ive said enough.in short,dont come to watch this if you want a coherent engaging film.but if you enjoy laughing through mind-bogglingly bad trash,then this is definately for you!!!! i laughed nearly all the way through it,so at least it was entertaining.1 out of 5	neg

Everythin was handled very professionally.  The tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged.  I will buy next tv through Amazon as well	pos
For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy. ---  --- The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures	pos

This phone is great!  It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the  low ringtone problem by searching for "audiovox 8610 hack" over the internet. ---  --- You can purchase a cable on ebay and d/l some free softwares over the net. Then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free.  Of course you have to be computer-savey to do so.  So don't do it unless you know what you're doing. ---  ---  --- The phone allows 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone.  The cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so you know who's calling by the ring. ---  --- I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the net and mix 'n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones.   ---  --- example:  3 stooges sound +  bell ring + whistle +  homer "doh" + wolf howl - all in one 20 second ringtone. ---  --- I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well.   ---  --- I noticed some songs and sound-effects are louder than others.  Thus I only keep the loudest  ringtone and they're very loud!  I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack. ---  --- Overall, this phone is always on sale at places like Target. If you can make your own ringtone and download it into the phone, you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dream of	pos
While we've used Coleman folding stoves for years, if you have trunk space, there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill. The small tank makes this practical for camping. If you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars, and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available, this is a great choice for camping equipment. We still like the Coleman for boiling water, but I love barbecuing on a propane grill like this	pos
I think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who the killer was, they're actually saying they guessed who the killer was and just happened to be right.  ---  --- Think about this for a moment: What was the motive? That was something I never figured out. The killer didn't have a motive. That's what threw me off. But I guess some would say a crazed killer doesn't need a motive. But come on! Even the deranged killer in 7even had a reason for killing. Even Norman Bates had a reason for killing. ---  --- It could be the reason was explained but I just missed it because the movie was so terrible. I don't know. I really don't want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out. ---  --- I know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles, one of them is the killer for sure; but you're thrown off by the fact that you have Andy Garcia, D.W. Moffett, and Sam L. Jackson. So all 3 are fair game	neg
The start button is too difficult for even a three year old to hold down. The battery is tedious to re-charge (required after every use!). Dangerous. When child leans slightly to the side the entire engine will turn over. For all your time and money you will only see a child with a bored expression - or a frustrated child who can't operate start button alone. You could tape down the button and then the child must ask for you to stop it. Total supervision required any way you look at it. A real expensive, gimicky toy!	neg
I have to admit I had little hope for the little sample of ground coffee that I received from Amazon as part of a free promotional package to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. However, against all odds, I find Millstone's product to be among the smoothest tasting coffees I've had from a package. Understand that I am mainly part of the mobile Starbucks-and-Peets crowd that's used to the aftertaste of the wooden stirrer and the slightly curdled milk when I swallow my caffeine. Normally I prefer grinding my own beans at home, but given my predilection for my infrequently used French Press maker, I occasionally enjoy a heaping brew of the roasted Colombian Supremo. Each of the sixteen packets is 1.75 ounces, enough easily for about six cups. I say give it a try as a relatively convenient alternative to your normal coffee run	pos
Why on earth am I giving this movie five stars?  Its plot is minimal.  The script has words and phrases I've never heard, and I'm not sure were ever really used in the real world.  And to top that off, it's more than a little unbelievable. ---  --- However, despite all of the possible downsides, I really enjoyed it.  Honestly, I'm normally not into these kinds of films, but it was just good fun.  The humor wasn't disgusting and gross.  The chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships believable (even if I don't ever buy the whole love at first sight scenario), and there wasn't some great moral constantly being shoved down my throat. ---  --- All in all, it was just a fun movie to watch, and it's been a long time since a movie simply put a smile on my face	pos
Alrightly. Folks it doesn't get any better than this. This magazine blends humor with serious reviewing. They will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite - like me! Anyhow, I've read this magazine for a while and I've never been disappointed. The "Ask the 800 lbs. Gorilla" section is a riot. The Bottomline gamer this is an unbiased, not corporatly owned (like OPM, and XBOX magazine) and a pleasing magazine to read. Anyone "hooked" on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a PSM and get a subscription.   	pos
A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out. ---  --- It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird. ---  --- Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes	neg

This digital camera is the best.  I cannot complain about any aspect of it.  It has a huge amount of modes and settings and additional features to add to pictures as you are taking them.  It's small enough to fit into your pocket and not think about it (it's smaller than a wallet).  It takes excellent pictures that come out looking great, all very high quality.  The huge screen makes it easy to view what you are looking at and has great image quality.  The videos are equally good, with great sound and good picture.  It looks better than just about any other digital camera that I have seen.  Even though I said I cannot complain, there are a few things that slightly annoy me occasionally.  The first is that it flashes twice.  Remember to tell this to people before taking their picture!  After the first flash, people tend to look away, and by the time the second flash comes and the picture is taken, the moment is lost.  This only occurs when the camera is set to "AUTO" mode.  I usually press the menu button and choose a mode.  When you do this, the flashes occur very quickly (you barely notice a gap between them).  Some of the features are very useful.  I use the "backlight" mode quite often.  It allows you to take a picture of something even if there is a bright light in the background.  My only other complaint is for those of us with large fingers, the circular button that operates pretty much every feature can be difficult to use (sometimes I push 2 buttons at once, or the complete wrong one).  But everything else that this camera can do cancels it out.  This camera has more features and better quality than many larger and more expensive cameras out there	pos

I would have given this product one star, but I did get several months of use out of it before it literally melted down into a useless steaming pile of plastic. ---  --- After about two weeks of use, the Electronic Mini-Stepper started creaking and groaning like it could snap at any moment. As previous reviewers have noted, the thing actually starts smelling of burning oil/plastic/metal. After two months of use, the shocks on both pedals started leaking fluid. Good thing I had a nice thick plastic mat underneath it. ---  --- I owned and used the Electronic Mini-Stepper for all of four months, using it five days per week (20-25 minutes per day), before the cable secured around the pully-wheel snapped loose of its moorings. This probably occured because of the extra strain put on the cable due to decreased pressure in the defective, leaking shocks. I now own a twenty pound, forty dollar door stop. ---  --- There's no reason, other than ultra-cheap construction, that a 160 pound man should be able to destroy a piece of exercise equipment like this in four months. During this time, I used nothing but normal exercise practices: smooth, even, steady steps...nothing jarring. Buyer beware on this one	neg

This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you. --- My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item.  --- Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it. --- I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper) --- Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap.

My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them.  She learned how to move about on them although a year later she's still quite wobbly.  The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use. My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop. No knob brake like normal skates have, so most of the time she's pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein. Also, the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own, so we have to dot it for her. It wasn't like that when I first bought it, though. We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these.	neg
I find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented D.J. to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar; Ripping off the kids droned and purged on the MTV feedbag, and this man Paul Wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them. ---  --- Notice his rhymes don't descend any futher than his mouth, his car and his money.

Dan Fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer. Unfortunately, the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts, songs that seem formulaic and "safe."

Serious Fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd. "Greatest hits" is not synonymous with "greatest music.&quot	neg
Quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 I purchased as gifts. In fact, the recipients asked me to return them. Main reason, in order for it to be "portable" it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $30. I already spent $100, not planning on spending more money. I think PhotoCo needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction.    	neg

Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did	neg

At first the case seemed like a good idea, but after the third use the zipper stopped working.

Bad design. Perhaps Velcro would have been better here. 	neg
I am only an amateur photographer, but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an SLR film camer costing a lot more, and a lot more complicated to use. I caught the digital bug sevearl years ago. My latest before this beauty was a simple little Canon SureShot 3mp. A great camera, but this camera has the same simplicity, but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than I paid for that camera four years ago!! This Panasonic Lumix has a Leica Lens, which can' t be matched by any other camera but it's twin Leica camera--a much more expensive piece of equipment. The long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog, but if you want an all around 35mm-12X camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses, like me, this baby is for you. It only looks massive. It is quite lite and manageable. I use it for bird photographsy, but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution. Don't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera? This is the answer. I love it, and I think your will, too. Easy to use, and easy on the wallet. If you're not quite there, try the next model down, with the same focal length but 6 mp, for a couple hundred less. Another terrific buy. No, I don't work for Panasanic.

This film does not come close to the quality of Once Upon a Time in China. First of all, the plot is weak, it does not have the kind of power that the original of this series did. The characters in this film seem like they are out of a comic book, while the characters in the first film were interesting and complex. The kungfu is mostly unrealistic wirework, and while Once Upon a Time in China had some of this, the emphasis was on realistic martial arts. In the original, the main characters were trying to resist the influence of the West which was destroying their culture, but in this version, the main characters are actually on the side of the Westerners and they are fighting their own people! There is no explanation of why Wong Fei Hung and his crew would side with the people who were their enemies in the last film. One of the reasons the original film was so good, was because it was about brave Chinese patriots trying to protect their culture, but in this film is seems as though they have switched sides	neg

This is a hit or miss product. I ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating (burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes), the product did work for a while. My extremely dry, curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working. I would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut, jojoba, almond, avocado before shampooing or after. I adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier. If you do want to try the product, ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them.	neg
I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these "noodles" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc.  If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile!  My advice for those who don't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them, sprinkle liberally with salt & rub through with clean hands, then rinse in cold water.  This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use	pos

I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking. ---  --- I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove. ---  --- When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.   ---  --- Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart. ---  --- In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for. ---  --- The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars! ---  --- I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet. ---  --- I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily	pos
I was eager to read this book, but after reading it I was left completely flat.  The rest of the iceberg?  Hardly. ---  --- Smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading Sports Illustrated, or any Minnesota sports page.  He admits he's not a fan of football, but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career.   ---  --- This book is touted as: his full and complete story.  So we learned he was watching Ren & Stimpy during his NFL Draft.  Wow, are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read? ---  --- How about telling us more of the inside details...  How did Smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player?  Who were his friends that he could trust, and when did he need that trust?  What thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent?  What was he doing when he was "goofing off and missing class all summer" which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at Ohio State?  When, and why did he begin using pot?  If football is not "smart" enough for him, why doesn't he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging?  What happened to plans for medical school?  We know the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented. ---  --- I also felt Smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of America.  Who is attacking him?  Why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much?  Highly paid athlete stories are, sorry for the pun, a dime a dozen.  He tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy.  The truth is, many people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes, they value things other than money, and yes, they are happy to have a job.   ---  --- Leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers, it felt like I was reading an average high school creative writing project.  'I did this, I did that, I went to bed, next day.'  Half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy: pop music.  Smith notes "less than 50 percent of Americans read at a 10th-grade level".  Well, this book certainly won't tax the reading ability of too many people. ---  --- One lesson from this book is that Smith had opportunities to swallow his pride, take some coaching, and come up with a better solution.  This book is another one of those times.  He should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance.  Build the characters; help us feel their stories.  Instead, Smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions.  Sorry, but compared to other autobiographies, this was not an emotional book. ---  --- I'm sure Smith is all the things that Mike Gutter says he is, such as: thoughtful, honest, trustworthy, dependable, passionate...  but I felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book.   ---  --- Instead, we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg.	neg

UPDATE OF MY REVIEW DUE TO JULY 2006 HEAT WAVE: I have two of these low-cost alarms set up, and both become quite intermittent when the temperature reaches 90 degrees and above (in the shade): Sometimes they go off when a person/car goes past, and sometimes they do not. As soon as the temperature decreases though, they become much more reliable. I WOULD NOT RECOMENDED THESE DEVICES FOR SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITH HOT WEATHER, SUCH AS ARIZONA, TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, ETC. Original review: I am very impressed with this alarm: It is accurately able to detect people coming up the stairs of my apartment, and sets off the indoor alarm -- and it has not sent out any false alarms (Most problems with this alarm (that I have read in the reviews below) appear to be caused by the sensor being in direct sun light. This seems to cause these units numerous difficulties, and should have been addressed in the Patrol Sensor's enclosed instructions -- but isn't. However, by simply shielding the outdoor sensor from all *direct* contact with the light of the sun by using tape or opaque plastic, or repositioning the outdoor sensor, appears to eliminate false alarms or no alarms). This alarm unit appears to be quite well made, and the price is, of course, incredibly low. Great buy!!  --- 	pos
I bought these extensions because I had to have them so that the co-sleeper would fit properly next to my bed.  However, when added the sleeper didn't seem as steady or stable on the floor.  There was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them.  While not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed, I expected something a little more solid or sturdy. 	pos
I ordered this magazine as a gift. I paid for it on Nov. 21 '05. It is now Feb. 19 '06, and my daughter has not yet recieved her Christmas present! I will never again place an order with Amazon!

I will at this point try to get my money back from this company, and my daughter can purchase the magazine and all the missed issues off the newsstand	neg
I mostly want a bookstand that would hold a paperback book for me.  This cannot do that at all.  However, that is not just because it is meant for large books.  It can't really hold textbooks very well either.  The one that I bought ended up in a box in storage, and I doubt I'll ever use it again	neg
I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement, however I was disappointed.  While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old.  If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily.  And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt.  Don't even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket.  Finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover.  If you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover, but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance	neg
Having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years, I approached digital photography with great reluctance.  I knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures, like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge.  Finally, an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue. ---  --- My choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006.  We ran them as a screen saver, and I was much impressed by the sharpness, color tonality, and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares.  Faces far into the background were discernable.  I asked what was used and it was this camera.  At the camera store I was heartened to see it felt like a mini SLR in the hand, had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated, straightforward controls. ---  --- The learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts.  Lack of no-shake feature is the model's biggest downside; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects.  Some of this you learn to shake out using point focus, but you still are going to lose a few  precious moments despite your best efforts.  Nor with the limited equivalent ASA range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good SLR and high speed film -- but remember, this one is a starter.  This thing is a monster battery eater, too:  always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you.  On the plus side, choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature, and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects.  Speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals, I don't know, but its a whole world superior to my old world.  There is a rather steely patina to even the best color images, I see now after viewing hundreds, but that's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity.  Incidentally, the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating. ---  --- Back from Europe this week, I have 2000+ jpegs (the keepers) all of very high quality, an achievement I could not have come close to, I am sure, either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals.  The continuing issue of shake and blur I surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot (sometimes 5-7 images); you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them, and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off.   ---  --- I do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera, but even after I move up I think I will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world.  For the price, this is about as good a deal as one can hope for.	pos

Works fine on Windows XP, but does not work well with Linux.  I've been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time, and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux.  My built in 10/100 NIC was much faster than this card would go.  Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that, of course, works with no issues.  Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box. 	neg
My 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for Christmas.  Since his dad and I are divorced, he ended up with both.  I got him the flowboard and he LOVES it.  Of course, I tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard.  There is no chance I'm even going to try the waveboard, as I do value my intact bones.  I've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding, but without the snow!  It's well made, fun and definitely a hit	pos
This camera is very similar to the Fuji F30, but has face detection (fd) that autofocuses on faces in a photo.  Great for taking pictures of yourself, or for snapshots you don't have time to compose.  Excellent quality photos in dim light. At 3200 ISO, photos are washed out and noisy, but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss. Option to limit ISO to 1600, or to 400. Camera will use any speed up to the limit. 400 ISO is extremely good. As good as my Canon Digital Rebel xti. Usual modes I never use (flower, landscape, etc.), but one unique mode I use all the time: no flash/flash. The camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 ISO, and then takes a picture with flash immediately after. Usually takes less than one second to capture both images. No flash doesn't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot, while the following flash guarantees you'll get the image, even if the "warm glow of candlelight" is ruined. I always have the camera set to this mode. Uses xD cards, which I hate, but if you buy a 1 GB card you'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card. Also, battery life is unbelieveable! Fully charge the camera over several hours, and you'll be able to take 400 photos, half with flash, before the battery is drained. Fuji-brand underwater housing is optional, watertight to 40m (121 ft.) Camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours, and still keep the intense blue of the water. Literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras. I recommend this camera without hesitation. There simply isn't anything else like it on the market. --- 	pos

This magazine would be a delightful reading experience for a wide audience. It appeals the *most* to busy young adults, who are looking for quick, healthy, easy-to-make delicious meals, which they just *might* want to spice up with an occasional adventurous new taste in wine recommendations. There is a wonderful column on "new flavors". In the June 2004 issue it is "lemongrass". In the July issue it is "miso". There are fine recommendations for new restaurants in exotic locales, such as, Bermuda or Sao Paolo, Brazil. Also included are foods for special holidays, such as in June for "Father's day". Naturally, grilling is the "haute cuisine" on this auspicious day. The recipes for "Salmon Nicoise Sandwiches" and "Tuscan Baby Back Ribs" are mouth-watering ...  ---  --- The "fast food" section is loaded with tasty healthful salads, such as, "Spicy Chicken, Avacado, and Mango Salad" and "Turkey and Green Bean Stir-Fry with Peanuts". Some grilling suggestions include, "Tandoori Pork with Gingered Mango Salad" and "Korean-Style Chicken Wraps". Needless to say, all the food is tempting and the recipes are not too difficult to accomplish, provided one is already familiar with cooking techniques. ---  --- Overall, the emphasis on this magazine is *not* on wine but instead on food. For a change of pace, the June issue has a very fine article on "vodka". In the July 2004 issue there is a superb article by Robert Parker called, "Australian Wine Guide". The regular wine column covers "German Reisling" by Richard Nailey. Most impressively, the July issue introduces the reader to "America's Best New Chefs of 2004". Of course, each selects a recipe to share. This magazine is loaded with unique articles for the adventurous cook and aspiring gourmand. Highly recommended. Erika Borsos (erikab93	pos
This collection of poems, tho representing a fine breadth of Dickenson's works, is in final assessment a crime against the poet's great talent.  As is freely admitted in the introduction, the editor, Mr. Higginson, "worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing the line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area."  This is a free admission of the book's guilt, having adulterated Dickenson's original poems in both content and form.  Gone are the nuances and passions that make Dickenson one of the best American writers.  Gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems' meanings.  And, worst of all, gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist.  As Thomas H. Johnson says in the Introduction to "The Complete Poems of Emily Dickenson," A representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate."  Do yourself a favor and avoid this text.  Instead, find one that is true to the original poems, one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author, and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of Emily Dickenson	neg
Loved the car seat, until my Daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps.

This is a nice addition to anyone's patio. The product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper. Assembly took around 30 minutes. As others have commented the holes don't line up naturally and did require some "finessing" in order to get lined up, but really wasn't that difficult to overcome. All that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench). Probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs. This seems like a good quality that I am confident will last for many years to come	pos

We got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it. We have a Graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice. You can hardly hear her on it.  --- The Baby Quiet Sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly. The receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use. Our Graco does that too so I don't know if that is the norm with monitors. The sound is the best when pluged in. The nightlight is great. The humidity function I have not figured out as of yet. It say's it is 19% in every room and I don't know that is correct. The temp works fine. I have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works. I like that the time is on the receiver and that it lights up to see it at night time. I haven't used the timer yet but could see how it could be helpful.  --- Over all - like my choice in the monitor.	pos

I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product.  With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem.

The Shure SM58 is one of the most recognisable microphones in the world - and for good reason.  It is the main stay of many a hire companies microphone hire stock, including mine (pa2hire.co.uk).  Practically unbreakable, and if you do manage to drop it from a high stage / skyscraper, you can also buy a replacement pop shield.  Very suited to rock, or other musical styles that need powerful vocals.  Make sure your singers lips are touching the pop shield to get the best results, though, unless they have very good mic technique.  The proximity effect (increase in bass when you sing or talk close to the mic) makes this important.  If the singer is a foot away from an SM58, the chances are they will sound thin, and you will also have gain before feedback issues.... --- Sonically the response has a nice presence peak in the upper mid range, but the top end rolls off quickly after that.  Opinion is split about whether that is a good or a bad thing - it helps keep a lid on feedback, but it doesnt sound as hi-fi as some other mics.  I have had some singers complain that their vocal top end is not quite right - sometimes asking for more top end.  I guess they are used to the sound of expensive condenser mics on their recordings.  My solution is normally to give them another mic, like a Beta 58, or Beta 87a maybe, rather than use EQ.  If you A/B test an SM58 verses these mics it will always lose.  But it can still be a better mic in some cases, such as when you are looking for a cardioid rather than hyper-cardioid response (the SM58 has a cardioid response, which means it has a wider pickup pattern at the front).  But most vocalists will be more than happy with the sound the SM58 gives. --- The SM58 also does a pretty good job on drums (not really bass drum), and other loud things like guitar cabs.  It uses the same capsule as the SM57, one of the best mics for guitar cabs. --- In conclusion, yes there are a lot of mics that sound better, and some of these are quite a bit cheaper - but ask yourself the question are they as durable as an SM58, and if you are a professional, will your clients want to use a mic they have never heard of?  ---  --- Take care, --- Justin Miller --- pa2hire.co.u	pos

This is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction.  Out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts, away from the creepy angst of punks.  This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and leading productive, respectable lives.  WHY NOT portray lesbians as beautiful, educated, clean, classy, talented, sober, drug-free, non-violent, non-"self-destructive", straight forward, honest...oh, and truly SEXY??  The Reno landscape in the 50's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered.  The filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.  The musical scores are superb!   --- The cast was wonderful!  Charbonneau and Shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other.  Just a masterful duette of performances!  Cay, free and fully out, forward and knowing just what she wants; Vivian, tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box.  Every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension. Two georgeous women making love??  HELLO!  The love scene is landmark.  Audra Lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as Cay's stepmom.  Cay's best friend, Silver, is absolutely a key role in the dynamics of these chracters; she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people, and deserve love and happiness.  We all need a little "Silver" in our lives!!  --- This story is completely intriguing, and HEY, what a wonderful ending!  SEQUEL, SEQUEL!!! This is an absolute must have in any collection.

These crackers are an excellent quality snack food. The classic cracker is a crispy, (Ritz-like) buttery cracker, with peanut butter inside, as described.  I bought a box at our local supermarket, before committing to the 4 boxes, and the kids & husband loved them! To save money, I bought them on Amazon. Each packet has 4 cracker sandwiches in them, so if you are like me, you'd like to know that your kids will eat the entire package! Most of the other brands have 6 in a pkg, so sometimes kids will toss what they can't finish during lunchtime.  The cost is about 0.62 each, and convenient.

I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try. ---  --- After one battery charge, I was "lucky" enough to have a defective unit - the camera wouldn't start again after the first charge. ---  --- My observations from that first short use were: --- - Quality of pictures was very poor (my Pentax Optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera. --- - The flash was generally useless, and actually hurt quality --- - The camera was very uncomforable if you don't have very small hands.  My wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes. --- - The video was ok, but the focus was very slow (and noisy). --- - I had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it (shows very poor quality). ---  --- All-in-all don't waste your money.

This effort shows it's age. In addition, there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of Mengele.

I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower. ---  --- Alvaro --- Sacramento, CA	neg
I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions.  I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events.  I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD.  This program does it all and more.  It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD.  After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results.  I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems.  Looks great on TV.  I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD.  Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos.  For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.  	pos

I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.

I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so. ---  --- Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not. ---  --- The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal. ---  --- AARO	neg

I thought these Gummi Bears tasted funny, like there was perfume in them.  I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears (or Gummi Bear wannabes), and these did not taste anything like those.  The flavors were not very distinct or fruity.  The texture was also very different and not very palatable.  I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin, and I assume that is why the texture is so different.  However, I have eaten another brand (Sunny Bears) of gelatin-free "Gummi Bears", and their texture was very different, more like jelly candy.  I would buy the regular Gummi Bears, but I am allergic to dyes and I can't find any that are dye-free except these and the Sunny Bears.   ---  --- After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them, they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item.  I was impressed	neg
One reviewer remarked that Morten Veland had "done it again."  Yup, he shot himself in the foot again, just like he did on Tristania's "Beyond the Veil."  Veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements, and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians.  His problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect, where it's appropriate, he just plasters it everywhere, and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible CD.  With all of the talent that is present in this band, it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more.  The songs where Veland does that (which are all too few), like "On the Wane," are easily the CD's best moments.  To the band's credit, the songs are more varied than on BOTV, with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs (especially at the beginning of the opening track).  It's definitely still melodic goth-metal, but shows some new directions for Veland, which I find promising.  Now, if he would just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the CD...Sirenia's next CD will be a sure winner	pos
I really liked the watch as it looked in the picture. But, when I purchased it, I realized that its way too shiny. If you have a thin wrist, then the watch looks really bulky.

The Good: Simple and easy to put together. Works as perfect as you would expect. Cleaning is as easy as using a brass brush occasionally. This little grill is a powerhouse, cooking most items in less than 5 minutes. Webber has world class customer service.  ---  --- The Bad: The grill works perfect right out of the box (put it together yourself) however, this is where the problem lies...the box. Whoever Webber got for their packaging really screwed up. They put the legs on the outside of the main grill container, as a result, the legs came smashed and the plastic that holds the small parts is stapled once allowing for most parts to slip through and out of the box. My grill came smashed, dented, and missing parts. I ordered a replacement directly from Webber which they sent me an entire grill at no charge without needing to send the smashed one back. It also came smashed. Instead of calling again, I used parts from both grills to make one that was not smashed up.	pos

Classic Walter Matthau film. I enjoyed it very much because of the easy & believeable relationship between Matthau & Hawn, the suppressed attraction between Bergman & Matthau & the sweet storyline. This film was made during a time where special effects didn't fill in for weak plots; instead the story actually makes its point.  Well done. ---  --- As bachelor dentist Dr. Julian Winston, Matthau tries to convince his mistress, Toni, (Goldie Hawn) that he has a wife who won't divorce him because they have children.  Toni's had enough: she fires off a letter (yes, actually walks across the street in her nightgown to deposit the letter in a mailbox)to Julian, telling him she's committed suicide.  Her young writer-neighbor, Igor (Rick Lenz), smells gas in the apartment hallway, breaks in & saves Toni. ---  --- When Julian receives the letter at his office, he storms off to Toni's apartment, only to find her alive & in the company of Igor.  This little stunt persuades Julian to ask Toni to marry him -- he'll get a divorce no matter what. The catch is now Toni wants to meet Julian's wife, she has to get to know her so that Julian's wife won't think of Toni as a home-wrecker. Enter Ingrid Bergman as Miss Stephanie Dickinson, Dr. Winston's long-suffering, never-married dental assistant.  Julian convinces Stephanie to pose as his wife for Toni. ---  --- What ensues is a calamity of coincidences & misunderstandings that cause true feelings to be revealed.  Ingrid Bergman is such a joy to watch, she effortlessly steals the show. ---  --- If you want light-hearted entertainment that will leave you with a smile on your face, this film is for you	pos
I've used EZ Up tents for years at trade shows and other venues. Since I saw a review here that said it was used as a shelter for 8 months and then it failed, I thought I'd point out that these are not permanent shelters. I had one fail due to rain damage once. Left it outside after our wedding (it covered the caterer table) and we had a torrential downpour. The canopy filled with rain, the weight broke the support. It was a tremendous amount of water, the equivalent of a person sitting on a single crossbar.  --- The reason EZ Up likely told the person they don't cover wind and rain damage is because in eight months, the thing had to have been rained on, and blown at.  --- If you're looking for a fast to assemble cover for trade shows, street fairs, etc. EZ Up's great.	pos
I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.

So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles	neg
This Samsung is the most reliable phone I've ever had. I've had it for two years, dropped it NUMEROUS times, and it is still going strong with only a few scratches. The battery life has declined during this period of time, but it still lasts about two days before charging. While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now, I am impressed with how many applications I use daily - alarm clock, scheduler, memo pad, etc. Reception is usually good too.  --- In all honesty though, the camera is not terribly great. Pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry. I still enjoy the camera, if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options (black and white, brightness, flash, etc.) to make pictures look decent. The video option is rather lame though, as the footage is choppy and you can't even transfer or send it to anything. --- Recently when I was on a shuttle, two girls, both with Razors, saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well. Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones. I am supposed to be getting a new phone too, but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up. If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone, this is a good one	pos
I have used this machine for a few months now, but have not made use of all possible features. However, this is what I can say: ---  --- * basic copying, fax, scanning -- Excellent --- * scanning with character recognition -- Excellent but would prefer to have options ala OmniPage --- * duplex printing(printing on both sides) -- Very Good, except the menu digging is ackward --- * build quality and overall performace -- Excellent, prints fast, few jams, feels very sturdy --- * ease of use -- very good and straight forward --- * features -- Excellent, loaded with capabilities ---  --- This machine is beautiful and no other machine I have used comes close, save for high end office machines costing $thousands. I can't get over how happy I am with this one, I've been waiting for a quality MFC since before they came out, and finally I am satisfied. Highly recommended	pos
The Rosetta Stone language software was a great investment. The product provides learning words together with listening, seeing, and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases. It provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace. The product has been worth it's hefty price. I do recommend purchasing a German/English dictionary to accompany the  software. I have also had in the past a basic German 101 course prior to using Rosetta Stone, so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the German language, such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings	pos
I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable.  ---  --- All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort	neg
The touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice. The onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen (easier sad than done). If anything does attach, it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer	pos

People is the most incredible magazine.  The writers of the magazine know exactly what you want to read as a subscriber, but there will always be an extra section that just does not interest you because no magazine can attract every ones personal interests.  No matter what this magazine always makes Friday a great day. ---  I feel the best part about People magazine is the fact that they give you special issues, like 50 Most Beautiful People, Sexiest Man Alive, and Eligible Bachelor.  You get a variety highlights in each People issue. ---  You will find inside each issue many sections pertaining to your interest.  A section called the mailbox where you get to read other people responses to the articles in the last issue released.  The passage page where they will give you all the details of celebrities such as marriages, births, divorces, deaths, injured, or convicted.  Finally, I love getting toward the end of the magazine just to be able to read the true crime stories because they are intriguing and quite interesting. ---  The only bad part about People magazine is that most people, just like myself, buy the issues to read about celebrities.  But you also get the human interest stories which  --- don't seem to interest everyone. ---  Now I do not have a subscription, but I read every issue, whether I buy them myself or read the magazine at work.  I would say that if you wanted to purchase a magazine this would be a great one to choose because the magazine reaches out to any one in their teenage years and up	pos

Unit appears to be solidly constructed.  Maybe I lucked out and got an upgraded version, but there have been a couple of reviewers that said the the plastic clamps snapped.  The unit I have (manufactured 11/06) has ALL METAL clamps, very much nicer than many regular standard jumper cables. ---  ---   ---  --- This unit will hold a charge but needs to be maintained (recharged) at least every 60 days or so.  ---  ---   ---  --- NEVER charge via the cigarette lighter adapter in your vehicle longer than 3-4 hours.  It may be left on AC charge indefinately.  It is better to keep it fully charged, discharging this unit will result in shorted cells. ---  ---   ---  --- All in all, a very small price to pay for peace of mind, at home and on the road.  With a power inverter (less than $20.00) you can have silent power source for lights, cell phones, small tv's, laptops, flourescent lights, etc.	pos
I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it.

But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good.	neg

This is the author's presentation of the Satipatthana Sutra, the basic sutra on mindfullness. As in all of his works he does the work of a good Dharma teacher very well. He keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the way so that the student's understanding can arise naturally. There are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the Sutra available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the Sutra in meditation. But this is good basic information presented in a good manner with no frills or personal quirks. The author gives a good commentary on the Sutra and explains why he translates certain passages, but he also gives the alternate interpretations.  ---  --- This is a fine basic introduction to the central issue in Vapassana meditation. Highly recommended	pos

Revolver's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are Hit Parader and Circus. I have bought all three of these magazines several times, and Revolver my final judgement is Revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to. The other two I still buy occasionally, but only for wallpaper (I cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room.)  ---  ---  This magazine is, in a way, like a combination of Circus and Blender magazines; it combines the best aspects of both. Revolver still has plenty of great pictures, but it is also much longer and much better written than Circus. It is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as Blender, but make sure you note that Revolver only reports on one genre (heavy metal!) whereas Blender could (theoretically) report on every genre (rap, pop, rock, etc.) ---  ---  Chances are, if a hard rock band (especially a big name hard rock band) is about to or has already released a C.D., Revolver will do a story about it. The stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them. If it's a cover story, an interview with the band is also included; if it's not a cover story, the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article, anyways (even though it's not a formal interview). Revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band (i.e. Lamb of God). In that case, they take the reader backstage, on the tour bus, and in a concert (with a rundown of the show). ---  ---  When I first started reading this magazine, there was a sexual theme to it. There would be a picture of a "hot babe" in a T-shirt, and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose. In the past year or so, Revolver phased that out (probably to appeal to a broader audience). I sometimes miss the pictures of the "hot babes," but this way there's more room for real heavy metal pictures. Yet, even though sex isn't a theme anymore, Revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager. Plus, there are usually profanities (mainly the "f word.") So, I would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up. ---  --- Monthly articles: ---  --- -Cover story --- -3 or 4 other biggish stories --- - "Fresh Blood" column (where a small biography is given on a band you probably haven't heard of) --- - Ask Vinnie (an column where readers write questions, and Pantera/Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul gives advice) --- - Hard rock news and notes --- - Black and death metal news and notes --- - "In the studio" (an update on bands currently recording new music) --- -Free poster (in the middle of the magazine, there's a fold-out poster of one or two bands.) The poster isn't very wide, but it is about two pages long --- -Free music downloads --- -"Ink Spot" (a story about a musician's favorite tattoo) --- -"Favorite sh*t" (an interview with a musician, with questions such as "What's your favorite color?") --- -Joke from a band (Revolver has just recently started doing this) --- - Reviews (reviews of C.D.'s, music DVD's, and video games) ---  ---  --- Pros: ---  --- --Plenty of good pictures and a free poster --- --Professionally written with well known writers (yet it is NOT too intelligent for teenagers) --- --Edited well (I haven't found any mistakes or typos) --- -The "fresh blood" column usually introduces me to a band I haven't heard of, but I should probably check out --- --Revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews --- --News columns (on both mainstream and underground metal bands) --- -The stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on --- --Free music! (Revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password, which he/she can then access free music downloads online.) --- --No stupid questions in interviews (they ask up to date questions, and sometimes-i.e. in the interview with Puddle of Mudd-the writers aren't afraid to ask daring, cutting questions) --- --The "In the studio" segment is always informative --- --Helpful, reliable reviews (they don't automatically praise every heavy metal C.D.) ---  ---  --- Cons: ---  --- --If you're up to date on your music news web sites, the news columns shouldn't really be anything new to you. --- --Not all C.D.'s are reviewed (they give a rundown on the C.D. in the article about the band, but C.D.'s from bands that are on the cover of the magazine aren't usually reviewed.)  --- -Concerts aren't reviewed --- -My biggest gripe is that it's only issued once a month. ---  ---  The bottom line is, if you're a metalhead, this is the best magazine you can get! It is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment	pos
Norton is now owned by the huge behemouth Digital River, who haven't a clue how to run support or customer service.

For the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.

When I first received the items they didn't work and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still don't work.  I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldn't even get them to work.  I sent them a e-mail to receive my money back, because I didn't want to keep spending money to send items back that don't work back.  Who would have guessed, but they never replied.  Thanks for waisting my time and money.  I will never buy any from you again and will inform others to beware	neg
I have used the fryer for chicken wings which is what I bought it for because I have plenty of parties throughout the year. Along with the professional look of the product, It performs great! If I could give it 10 stars I would. It is the best fryer I have ever used, and that says alot. I would recommend this fryer to anyone looking to enhance their outdoor cooking and bring it to that next "level".	pos
I'm not one for guns in my household, but my potty-training son really wanted this blaster gun. He's a total Star Wars fan (like his father) and I told him that he could have it if he said good-bye to diapers. He did. So we ordered it and waited for the UPS man to come. He was so excited when it was delivered. He thought the UPS man was so cool for giving that to him! Anyways, there is so much detail on this blaster gun. The sounds are pretty cool and it lights up red. My son loves the sight scope too! Big hit in our household!!!	pos
PS2 is far from dead!! ---  --- Square-Enix has done it again!!!!   First off, I am going to say I love this game!!! I'm a big turn-based/stategy RPG fan. But I would say this gamefs battle system is semi-real-time with strategy elements and I love it!!  I would have to compare the battle system to the likes of Parasite eve and Vagrant Story!!  With the same elements still present from the original Valkyrie Profile.  This is probably the best RPG I have played all year.  I strongly recommend this game to any RPG fan and will definitely satisfy until FFXII!!!  Now for the review:  ---  --- Graphics: 5 out 0f 5 Simply amazing I knew the old PS2 still had it in her.  This game has some of the best graphics you are going to see on the PS2, you may see some pixilation but hardly noticeable unless you are looking for it...  The detail in the characters, background and dungeons are amazing.  I really get taken back to Vagrant story when I play this game.  And OMG the special attacks look ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!  Perform a special attack and your jaw will drop.  I canft say anything negative about the graphics in this game what so ever especially being last generation.  ---  --- Sound:  4.5 out 5 The game sounds great!!!  The voice over are well done!!  Battle cries are wonderful and will take you back to the original Valkyrie Profile unless of course you purchased it on the PSP then it wont take you back very farcLOL    ---  --- Controls 5 out of 5 Okay I donft thing I have played an RPG with better controls.  You play on a 2D screen side scrolling with outward and inward exits and entrances press up or down accordingly to access them.  Anyone who has played the first one knows exactly how it works.  The first new thing you will notice is the new battle control scheme.  The old is you still have to press X,O, , or  to correspond to the character you have assigned to that button, still works great!!  The new is that now you are able to roam in 3D once you are in battle mode and this works great I explain in the Gameplay section.  L2 lets you find and switch targets, and then you just analog to get there.  ---  --- Gameplay 5 out of 5 Dare I say umm perfect!?!?!?  First I will address the two things I loved about the original Valkyrie Profile that you will find in this sequel/prequel!  1st thing - I began to get really annoyed by RPGfs now a days that make you have to talk to nearly every single person in a town to move the story along. This is never a worry in the Valkyrie Profile series.  You go to a town if there is something of importance there CG or AI takes over all you have to do is listen/read and then go shopping or if you really want, talk to the limited amount of people in that town, but it is normally just random talk nothing of real importance to the story.  Or you may have to talk to some people to fnd side quest maybe?  Many of the RPGfs I have tried to play lately suffered from thiscI mean who has the time to sit and play a game for hours only to be left feeling like you barely accomplished anything, cause you couldnft find the right person to move the story along?   ---  --- 2nd thing is the battle system, being able to press a certain button numerous times and watch that character spring in to action was always a joy.  Lets you feel more involved in battle instead of just letting you sitting and watching.  The new additions are GREAT additionscfirst the free roaming in battle.  You can move anywhere on the 3D battle screen you want within the parameters of course.  Since you are able move anywhere on the battle screen Square-Enix thought it would be a good idea to allow you to split up your party, and they were right!!  Basically you have a party of 4; but you can split them up into 2 teams.  Imagine this if you willcyou send one team to either fight a separate group of enemies or you can send one group to draw attention and use the other group to attack from behind taking the enemy by surprise and normally causing more damage.  Strategy has been added!!!   Other notable mentions: Special attacks are Stellar, Enemy Bosses are huge, and characters are very likable.  Also while in a dungeon you can still turn foes to crystal and use them to aide you in reaching different areas, but dig this!!  Now you can turn a foe to crystal then shoot that foe a second time to transport yourself to its position. Ex. You see an enemy on the ledge in front/above you but you cannot reach him or the ledge by simply jumping.  So you shoot diagonally at him freeze him shoot a second time and you are immediately transported to his position on the ledge and he is transported to your old position.  How cool is that? ---  --- Story (So Far) 4 out of 5, the story so far is great and from what I can tell takes place before the original Valkyrie Profile, I am only about 40% in to it but so far I am really drawn in to it, I cant go in to more detail for the sake of spoiling it, but it is intriguing.  ---  --- Bottom Line:   If you are an RPG fan you MUST have this title in your library of games, it will not disappoint.  With the combination of the GREAT original gameplay, stellar graphics, intriguing story, and innovative new features this is one not to be missed.  Even if you are not an RPG fan I would still recommend this as a rental. ---  --- 	pos

This is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies.  The bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense.  Also, the bag can hold a lot of accessories.  I had to Canon Rebel XT bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment.  The flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder, but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge!  The top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map.  The all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it.  The bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag.  Basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything.  Yes, I have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable	pos

This tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both.  As a RN with dermatology experience I have used many tools, I like this one as it saves you from bruising, or squishing your skin. So it solves the problem with a minimum of damage.  If you haven't used anything like this it may take some getting used to, but it's way better than using your fingers.  I gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small	pos
Lovely jewelry, great price, but the clasp is pretty tough to work. This is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person	pos
I am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera. Probably below average. I started trying to use 100% Sony electronic products because my computer was a Sony and Sony-Sony linkages make for easy use. Given that, here is what I think of the product: ---  --- 1. It is amazing how much camera you can get for the money. Compared to just 6 months ago, or a year ago, this is a lot of camera for the money. It is very small, fits easily in your pocket, but takes great pictures. Also, it is very easy to use and recharge.  ---  --- 2. A visit to the Sony website, suggests that Sony has new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras that are very similar.  This makes it hard to compare cameras, even within the Sony brand, and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it. ---  --- 3. A problem with this camera, given it is so small -- do not shake. Your pictures will be blurry. I am a typical guy, with very little fine motor control. My hands have trouble holding small objects. Holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture -- well the results are not pleasant. ---  --- 4. I tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras. I guess if you really want to zoom in, then you have to go to a big camera. But it still seems like the small cameras could offer more. ---  --- 5. Having said all of that, in the end, this camera is small and easy to carry, light weight, durable, and it is also easy to use. When you look at it, it looks well made. I ended up giving the camera to my in-laws, because they lost theirs. My in-laws tend to be technologically challenged. I said to them, just leave the dial set to the little green camera, and snap away. I have to say - they love this camera.  ---  --- Overall. For the money, a great purchase, technology is amazing. Just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than I have.   ---   	pos

I bought a Netgear WG311T wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed.  First, I coudln't get a connection to the router.  Two conversations with tech support in India produced the information that I had to download a new driver for Windows XP-SP2 from the internet.  I installed the new driver, which allowed me to connect to the router, but not reliably to the internet.

Beginning with the introduction, I was taken on a fabulous journey. These gifted authors write a wonderful narrative.  Lande's Snapshots add a lot to this impressive and comprehensive companion. They are as engaging as any short story in the New Yorker! --- I found the collection of old posters designer appealing integrated with beautiful photography, as one would expect from National Geographic.  --- The Guide is uniquely for both armchair and active travelers and TWO books in one. The first carefully expertly evaluates Top Ten lists on everything travel related, from Hotels to Hideaways, National Parks to International Markets.  Subjective of course.

I find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and I also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen TVs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen TV. These movies scream out for the widescreen, they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible. Yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen TV and, with one exception, all the people who have written about them dont seem to care. "Oklahoma", "Carousel", "South Pacific" and "King and I" need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen (also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well). Fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future (ie observe the two versions of "An Affair to Remember") of course, this is a major rip off, so anyone with a widescreen TV who has not bought these films --HOLD OFF, coz sooner or later they will get a proper release...How long? That is anybody's guess, but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen DVD technology ("Sound of Music" is fine and "State Fair" was made in non widescreen full screen format, an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen	neg

This is a wonderful film. It has powerful messages.  There are numerous examples of how teamwork acheives something.  My favourite is the tale we are told in little scraps about how the kid sister got wounded driving a guy to the air base - so he could fly a fighter and shoot down some Japs. ---  --- The film is emotionally very powerful.  It is designed to make you hate Japanese people, and to support bombing of enemy cities. ---  --- There was a war on - there was a need to get people to support such policies. ---  --- Since the official policy was to put Japanese Americans in concentration camps, the film justifies the policy. ---  --- Similarly the film portrays the effectiveness of US military equipment such as bomb-sights in a positive way.  They were hardly going to portray it as hopeless. ---  --- The film is not historically accurate.  It would not have been helpful to have produced a historically accurate film.  CNN reports about Kosovo in 1998-99 were just as inaccurate for the same reasons	pos

Hermann Baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd. I don't think that there is recording of the Haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance, even better than Tuckwell's. The cadenzas are absolutely awesome. I haven't listened to the Rosetti before but Baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well. Clevenger plays ok on the Haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. I'm a saxophone player but I can recognize  true musicianship when I hear it and Baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. Highly recommended	pos
You can shave anything without putting future fatherhood at risk, though  it takes some patience to get things really smooth. I've used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems. My skin was a little sensitive after the first time, but no terrible pain or anything, and there's none at all now that I'm accustomed to using it. It is possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving, but if you read the instructions first you should be fine. A couple of very minor drawbacks: It's rather noisy, more so than a regular electric razor, and if you use the comb attachments, it's tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the same time.

I think its safe to say that this game sucks! Before I got this game I thought it would be great. I had heard so many good things about it. Once I got it though I realized that this game wasnt as great as everyone said it would be. The Graphics are ok but the gameplay and sound dont impress me at all. Plus you dont get your lightsaber until level 7 unless you use cheat codes. As for all the talk about you being able to use the force the force is pretty weak in this game. You also dont get the force until level 7 and on some of the missions you cant even use all your force power like lightning, push, pull, ect. Really the only good force power is grip.(Grip allows you to choke people)Another thing that sucks is that there are different powers of the force so when you finally get the force you have to build up your power of the force for a few levels (wich could take hours) to finally get your force power strong enough to kill the enemy, not just wound him. This game is also EXTREAMLY hard. Its like Metroid Prime were you can get lost and it'll take a long time to find your way around. If you still want to get this game after reading this review is suggest renting it first.(Dont Be Dumb like me and buy it without renting it. I wasted $50	pos

It made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired, plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times I used it.

This gauge works well and is easy to read. It seats well and does mostly what it should. --- There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up. --- First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings. --- Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions). --- The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage. ---  --- Very Nice Gauge	pos

I've been using SpySweeper for 2 years now.  It generally does what it is supposed to do.  However, it was nearing time for me to renew.  SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew.  Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too.  With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging.  Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date.  Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription.  Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates.  I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone	neg
King Vidor's rather contrived adaptation of Tolstoy's epic riddled with miscast actors, a boring script, and a hurried screenplay.  In short, another one of those 50-year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into Hollywood's vaults of oblivion. ---  --- The story follows the main characters of Tolstoy's novel such as Natasha (Audrey Hepburn), Prince Andrei (Mel Ferrer), and Pierre (Henry Fonda.)  The film is too short for the novel and the acting stinks: particularly that of Henry Fonda as Pierre.  Henry Fonda is as stiff as fossilized wood in this film; his pondering stare and preaching voice reminds me of a bad Charleton Heston film.  As far as the battle scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer, they are as sparse as they are realistic.  All of the costumes and props in this film are horribly fake. ---  --- In short, the only thing that remains impressive about this film is the fact that Hollywood bothered to put it on DVD.  Apart from that, the acting is as worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue.  Don't buy this film	neg

I feel duped! I bought Spy Sweeper at the computer store a year ago. It was the 2.6 version. At first everything was great. I got my definitions, it found traces, it detected spy cookies. When I ran the definition update, I had no problem with the firewall. Every time they said upgrade, I did. Then I started getting renew e-mail. I had months to go and they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three a week and I ignored them, not only because I knew the year wasn't up, but I also was suspicious that it was just another spammer out to get my credit card information. I e-mailed them asking if their renew mails were really from them, voicing my concerns. I got ignored, to when I eventually got to speak to someone, they didn't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like! The problems began when I updated the latest version which is the 4.5. When I would try to update my definitions I'd get a warning that there's was a problem and contact webroot, while it had no problem noting that I had the latest version updates. No settings were changed, not even my firewall which was blamed by them. I think it's them not me since now it's suddenly happening. They refuse to address it. Then I checked their site about my subscritpion. I knew I had one because I bought it at the store, my subscription doesn't expire until June and if I was invalid I doubt I could upgrade to newer versions. What did their page say? No subscription! When I wrote I never got a straight answer about it. Then I was told that the program was corrupted, download a new copy of the latest version from their site. I did. What did I get? Boxes that said subscription not activated. They knew I had one and they won't change it on their site or give me explanations. After pestering does my latest version now say when I expire. I've asked why it goes online to scan when it doesn't need to and I get ignored. So I decided to call but wasn't sure how because I'm in a different time zone. It took several days for them to get back to me by e-mail saying that their Mountain Time is treated like my Eastern time to get a hold of someone. The first person I spoke to after four tries at 15-20 rings each, was nasty, especially when I told him to slow down because he mumbled. I downloaded what he told me to do, he said nothing about the firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets about it.The second person sounded like he'd smoked one too many joints after he decided to answer the phone after 15 rings. He didn't know how to answer any of my firewall questions or why their page kept saying I had no subscription when the program in it's latest version finally admitted I'm current after pestering.  They don't give you straight e-mail answers. They don't answer their phones hoping that after the 15th ring you'll give up. It won't scan everything even when no other programs are running. In the new version it found a spy cookie, it kept repeating the same one over and over despite my checking it as "always remove".Never did that with the previous versions. I don't like a company who answers questions selectively. I don't like a company who makes you wait 20 rings. I don't like a company who blames your computer settings when they never affected the previous versions. Webroot's Spy Sweeper will be replaced in my desperate search to find a spyware program that actually works, and whose staff answers my questions and not mislead me about my subscription status	neg
Bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room.  The entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly.  Works well, looks good and feels solid.  Highly recommend for this use	pos
I just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song.  Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this CD.   ---  --- MY VOTE - DO NOT BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff.  BUT GET THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great.  ---  --- 	neg
I enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera.  My Minolta Dimage X (about 15% small in size than this camera) had reached the end of its useful life, having been around for about 5 years.  The Minolta had a 3/4" screen on the back.  (this one has a 2.5" screen- great colors) ---  --- The best feature I liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens.  I don't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty.  Therefore, I was excited that this camera had an internal zoom. ---  --- Tonight I was at a Bulls game, in the 300 section (nose bleed), and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of Kirk Hinrich.  The 3x optical zoom is incredible, but more so incredible is the digital zoom.  I was also able to zoom into the jumbotron, and it looked as crisp as if I was taking the photo directly.  ---  --- Action shots are GREAT. Low light shots are GREAT!   ---  --- It is exactly what I was looking for 	pos
I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will admitt this is not a good album. The worst being "Home" which uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to. Most notably is "Clevland is the City" which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any "harmony" to it. Other songs worth mentioning are "What About Us", "Not my baby" and "Pump,Pump",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released	neg
These earrings are a good size but still very light.  It is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them, but once hooked they stay safely closed all day.

The author is an owner and operator of a tutoring center. He is not an expert in auto mechanics.  As he points out on the back cover the pictures and the concepts were for teenage boys and the accompanying graphics are of poor quality. ---  --- If you actually want to learn anything substative of autos this is a poor poor choice. You are better of visiting the automotive section of www.howstuffworks.com or some similar website to learn more with better graphics and for free. ---  --- I bought this book long time ago and finally had the time to look at it and I regret it	neg
I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad	neg
Terrible product.  Printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly.  I've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens.  Even though I have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement, which I have had less than a year, Kodak support says it cannot be fixed by me and I need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks.  A new one sells for $99 and the price is dropping fast.  I told Kodak support I would not send it back to them, spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye. I further notified Kodak that I would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill. ---  --- Also, I've heard that the recommended fix (which does not work, by the way), unplugging the unit to reset, will cause the color cartridge light to illuminate prematurely.  With the cost of paper and cartridges, this last insult makes this printer one to avoid.  1 star because when it does print the prints look good, but, man, the aggravation to get this thing to work correctly is not worth any price.  Rushed to the market place without enough reliability testing on an unsuspecting public.  Total junk from a venerable name desperate for a hit product. 	neg

I am 14. I used to read this about two and a half years ago. It was a pretty good magazine back then, with health tips, some real life stories, and even things like sex questions (which is saying alot more than some of these other magazines.) It wasn't packed full of teenyboppers and cheesy glitter makeup. I liked it, and if it was still the way it was, I'd probably still be reading it. But now, it's gone. I read my last issue one year ago and gave it up. It got way to young for me. All they talk about is celebrities (aka JoJo, Good Charlotte, Hilary Duff, Jesse McCartney, Usher, etc.) Alright, two of them make some passable music, but what about the others? They're talentless! Plus, I do not see anything that would appeal to anyone over the age of 13. They refer to guys as "hotties" and "babes," and they just put the same person on every five pages! There are stupid quizzes to tell you your kissing type or how psychic you are (seriously.) Half the magazine is huge posters for your room of airbrushed teeneyboppers. If you want a magazine with real substance, try Seventeen (highly reccomended), CosmoGirl, Teen Vogue, and maybe Teen People (I don't know, it's kind of lost its fun factor.) Some of these magazines may not be "appropriate" to the people that read this magazine, but I personally think it is better for young girls to learn the hard honest truth about the world than to be obsessed with pop stars and the latest Mary-Kate and Ashley gossip.	neg

I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera. --- After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue.

I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.  ---  --- My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that "very best of" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.  ---  --- Some reviewers are saying there's "heart and soul" all over this album?  --- That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.  ---  --- As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very "modern" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on. ---  --- Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new "very best of" collection)	neg
This step stool is a safety hazard. The sides are not angled enough so a two-year-old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over. In fact the stepping surface is so small that it's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it. And when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs	neg
I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed. The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definately not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	neg

First, here are some general positives about Jaci Velasquez: ---  --- - She is a very gifted singer. Her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. ---  --- - She is beautiful. And unlike a previous reviewer, I do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty. I like beautiful singing voices. I like beautiful women. There's no difference. ---  --- - She has great spiritual depth. Her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love, faith and joy. ---  --- Now, here's a critique of the CD: ---  --- I listened to all the music samples (as you can do as well) and only one song caught my attention - "Lay It Down". The other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste. But the song "Lay It Down" was different. It sounded more acoustic, more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music. ---  --- I found the sound clip of "Lay It Down" to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970's - Eric Carmen's "All By Myself", later covered by Celine Dion in 1996. "All By Myself" is a ballad having a soft, understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus. The sample clip of "Lay It Down" appears to be in the same mold. It has a soft, understated introductory verse; however, it seems to lack an explosive chorus.  ---  --- Listen to the sample and hear it for yourself. The introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics: ---  ---   "All of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans ---    Are slowly slipping through my folded hands" ---  --- So far, so good. There's only a piano and a violin accompanying Jaci's soft vocals. Next, the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics: ---  ---   "So I'm gonna lay it down ---    I'm gonna learn to trust You now" ---  --- Now here's a problem. I am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of Jaci Velasquez to showcase her voice. But it is not forthcoming. Why?  ---  --- This intrigued me and I wanted to hear the whole song but I did not want to purchase a CD for only one song. Luckily, I discovered that a compilation CD of Jaci Velasquez's best songs was released recently and it contained "Lay It Down". Great! I bought the CD - "On My Knees: The Best of Jaci Velasquez".  ---  --- This is what I discovered after listening to "Lay It Down". ---  --- - The first time through the verse and the chorus, the song is definitely understated. We simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with Jaci's soft vocals. ---  --- - The second time through the verse and the chorus, a drum beat is introduced and Jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs. But somewhat to my dismay, this is not the same voice that I am expecting from Jaci Velasquez. Her voice was more raspy and raw (actually, it was sounding more like Demi Moore or Tara Reid, not that that is necessarily bad). Furthermore, she appeared to be struggling. ---  --- Is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as "On My Knees", "Speak For Me", and "Adore"? Is Jaci Velasquez losing her voice? ---  --- I don't know but I find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20's is losing her voice. She is entering her prime. Barring a health issue, this just doesn't happen. ---  --- "Lay It Down" is actually a pretty good song. In fact, I am almost of the opinion that it may be her best. I certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others. ---  --- "Lay It Down" has the same message as the Beatles' classic "Let It Be". The words are different but both songs share the same sentiment. Actually, now that I think of it...they do share a couple of words in common...the words "let it be". Here are the closing lyrics: ---  ---           "I'm gonna let it be, I'm gonna let it go ---            I'm gonna lay it down" ---  --- The essential lesson being conveyed is learning to "let go and let God" - a profound spiritual insight. Something that each of us here is learning. ---  --- This song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching. And though her voice is struggling through it, the song, nevertheless, works out its magic.  ---  --- I gave this CD 2 stars because I think Jaci Velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded. Interestingly enough, her best sound was her first CD - Un Lugar Celestial (A Heavenly Place). Bring back the spanish/flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound. In my opinion, the acoustic sound is more spiritual. Keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects. Develop a Latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz. Hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player. Emphasize ballads. That should do the trick	neg
I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end.	neg

I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device. Its stylish, beautiful, small, and it has some awsome features. However, since i bought it from Amazon, Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. So I constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card... when it wasn't. Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL. Overall, Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. But whatever I love shopping @ Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too. :)!!	pos
Toby is one of the regulars on the Thomas & His Friends TV series, and this little wooden tram engine is well-made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets. ---  --- My only complaint - and this is very minor - is that Toby is a bit taller than other wooden Thomas engines, meaning that he cannot fit under bridges very well	pos

As gifted a story teller as he is a veterinarian, James Herriot has the rare ability to bring out every emotion known to the human race with a single magical flick of his pen. Every Living Thing is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of a master, and is possessed by a single, true trait that is difficult to find in many commercial books- every single tale is told straight from the heart. You will never fail to laugh at the hilarious tales and cry at the most poignant moments. If you're an animal lover, or even just have a passing interest in animals, this is a book you will hold on to and re-read until the end of your days. Kudos, James Herriot, you are very much missed	pos

This book reveiw is on a book named Last Summer with Maizon.  This book is about two best friends named Margarate and Maizon who lives on Madison Street.  Her friend Maizon was accepted to Blue Hills, a school where really educated people go.  Margarate does not want them to be separated.  Every night she wishes Maizon will not get accepted.  But when Margarate's father has a second heart attack, he dies and now all Margarate has is Maizon, her mother, her little brother Jay and the people around.  Margarete was having a rough time anyway and then Maizon got accepted to Blue Hills.  When it was time for Maizon to leave Margarate, her mother and Maizon's grandmother dropped her off.  When Maizon wasn't there with Margarate her whole life changed.  At school she was becoming popular, she was liked now.  Days passed by and Maizon still didn't call.  When Margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house, that's when Maizon calls.  Margarate was so excited that Maizon wanted to come home.  Margarate ran to the grandmother's house telling her the news.  Margarate said Maizon wants to come home, the grandmother says that she would go get her.  When Maizon got home it was like old times, they ran into each others arms.  They then went to their favorite spot and started talking.  Maizon said she came back because she wasn't being treated right, she didn't feel the same. So they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend Maizon.  I think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars.  This book has mostly everything of real life.  It deals with best friends, for example like my friendship with Kiena.  It has separation, like my sister and me.  It has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson.  I think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real life,it shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life.  I like this book because it reminds me of my life, me and my friends, how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking.  It reminds me of how I lose people in my family and then cry because I miss them.  If I could buy this book, I would let my whole family read it, I would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do.  This book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it.  It is so good that I really read it because I don't really read books and when I read the book it made me think of when my best friend Ariel was going to move and how it made me feel, and how I compare it to Margarate and Maizon.  This book is excellent, the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend.  If you ask my best friend Johnniece, she'll say that she really enjoyed the book, that it should get five stars, because the author really put thought, confidence, respect, love, care and her whole heart into this book.  When I say she put confidence in this book I meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit.  The author thought about the words, thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion.  I think that this book should be the book of the month in my school, because it shows and teaches a lesson.  With the summary I wrote I put my heart in it because when I read it, it touched my heart.  I won't want my friend away from me.  I think that I mostly relate to Maizon, because when she left Margarte was beginning to be liked, and the girl was talking about Maizon and Margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend.  I relate to Maizon, I relate to her because if people don't like me, I don't care.  If people want me out of somewhere, then I'll leave and if people love me, I love them back and that's how Maizon is.  She doesn't take junk.  Alot of people relate to Maizon.  This book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on.  This book is really a good book that shows you friendship, break-up and everything else that deals with real life.  I love this book, it is really good and I think that if most people had this book then they wouldn't be out doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing.  This book really didn't grasp Dr. Kings dream because when Maizon went to Blue Hills, the whites were treating her bad, they saw her different.  Brenliniqua, Class 7-512	pos
This eyeliner really matches the description, it goes on super smooth and doesn't tug or drag.  I was told at the counter that it was "water resistant" but it's really not.  I used to wear it under my lower eyelashes, but by the end of the day, it would be totally smudged and gross.  I would even try to put powder over it, but to no avail.  However, in defense of Laura, I am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes aren't friendly to many pencil eye liners.  I was just hoping against hope that Laura's would be different!

Dr. Amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family.  The stigma associated with mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome. Understanding the root causes, particularly the genetic predisposition within families, is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems.  These problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse:  they do not deal with the biological root causes.  Once those are dealt with, the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life.  However, without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions, one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch.  Take my advice.  If the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar, get help as recommended.  You will become a new person, the one you were created to be.  And that is a wonderful thing	pos
In truth, there really hasn't been a great Mana game since Secret of Mana back in 1993.  Every Mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings, and Children of Mana is no different.  Why did I buy it knowing this?  For the same reason many Mana fans continue to invest in Mana games.  There's always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that Secret of Mana did.  Unfortunately, Children of Mana does not do this.  It doesn't rekindle the magic Secret of Mana gave us, but that shouldn't suggest it falls short of it either.  ---  --- The world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages.  It is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you'll set out to save the Mana Tree and the world itself.  Children of Mana by no means has a great storyline going for it.  At least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in gameplay. ---  --- No matter how you look at it, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler.  It is an RPG, but it falls into the dungeon crawling category.  When you enter dungeons they're just swarming with monsters, and you'll be surrounded before you know it.  So you'll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss, take him on, and then you're done.  Rinse and repeat.  The process does, at times become annoying, but Children of Mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the gameplay to make up for it.  ---  --- The first tidbit of interest is how combat works.  It's actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things.  It's surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours.  You've got three hit combos you can perform on enemies.  You can knock enemies into other enemies.  There's quite a bit of intersting things you can do.  However, what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you can't ahead of yourself too fast.  First and foremost, you can't equip and use everything you find right off the bat.  The game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations.  This keeps the game from being too simple. ---  --- You'll also have access to magic, of course.  Each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you.  It's interesting to play around with as well.  In dungeons you can also dual wield weapons, although not in the way you'd think.  When I say duel wield I specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time.  So you can't go about swinging both of them at the same time, which probably would've added more variety to the gameplay otherwise.  ---  --- Along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons, you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities.  It's interesting, but not really all that deep.  You'll mostly find or purchase these gems. ---  --- Another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many sidequests the game has to offer.  Children of Mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on, and they're actually pretty well worth it.   ---  --- The problem with the gameplay, however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast.  The objective in just about every dungeon is to find what's called a "Gleam Drop" and then bring it back to the "Gleam Well."  It's annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way.  Fight through a horde of enemies, retrieve the Gleam Drop, fight a boss and leave.  Over time it becomes increasingly repetative.  However, Children of Mana has a great remedy for that too.  It's multiplayer.  Up to four players can play at a time, and the game is so much more fun that way.  You and your friends can make your way through dungeons together, and sometimes it's just a blast to do.  There are moments of slowdown when playing in multiplayer mode, but it's nothing to get too frustrated with, because it doesn't happen too often.  The multiplayer alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the gameplay.    ---  --- As far as graphics go the game doesn't look too bad.  The sprites look like they're ripped straight ouf of Sword of Mana... and the game is completely 2D.  However, the Mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit, they've been about its unique art style, which in Children of Mana is absolutely gorgeous.  It's artwork is just beautiful to look at.  Each environment is given extremely good detail.  The only problem, as I mentioned, are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed.  Musically, Children of Mana sounds fantastic.  It's one of the best sounding DS games out to date.  Very few of the current games hold a candle up to it's fantastic soundtrack.  ---  --- The bottom line is simple: Children of Mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline.  There's just enough variety and interest in the gameplay to keep one going for the adventure, even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with.  However, keep in mind that Children of Mana really is just a dungeon crawl, and it's uncrealistic to expect an RPG that's all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away.   ---  --- On the whole, if you're looking for a game that's fun, you'll find it with Children of Mana.  However, if you're looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters, you won't find it in Children of Mana. ---  --- The Good ---  --- +Beatiful Artwork --- +Fantastic Soundtrack --- +There's a lot of variety to the gameplay --- +Multiplayer is a blasts --- +Tons of sidequests to do ---  --- The Bad ---  --- -The storyline isn't good --- -The gameplay has a lot of vareity, but it's hard to get past the fact that it's repetativ	pos
I had this when my daughter was first born. It worked OK but she seemed pretty curled up in it. When she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped-- luckily I had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything. I was able to return the product, but I bought the Snugli carrier instead-- I would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles.	neg
I bought this camera because I'm going to Jamaica and I needed a camera, the video camera was a bonus. When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day.  --- I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money. --- I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera. I would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option	neg
We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex	neg
we have hardwood floors so i bought this together with Playzone.  i'm pleased with these mats --these made it safe for the frequent falls my baby went through when he was learning to crawl and pull himself up.   now i put these mats beside his bed, softening his occasional 'dreamy falling off' his bed	pos

This is the only fragrance I have found that truly smells "tropical".  This is my boyfriends favorite scent, and he thinks all perfumes "stink".

I bought this chair used and I don't think it's worth the $50 I paid for it. I also have the Fisher Price chair  (I have twins) and that one is SO much better - I wish I had 2 of those. First, like everyone has said, it is ridiculous to clean. Those people who said it's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess. Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner, especially under the seat.  ---  --- Most importantly, the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight. The tray also doesn't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap. ---  --- Finally, the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand. The FP high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher. ---  --- ONLY BUY THIS CHAIR IF THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT IS HOW IT LOOKS	neg
Like so many new-age artists, Ryan Farish has a great ear for melodies. Unlike most new-age artists, Ryan Farish has rhythmic problems. He likes to use the delay effect on his piano, but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing (sometimes it's one problem and sometimes it's both). I don't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album. Also, the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly	neg
I bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant, and so far I've been very pleased. I wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when I'm out running errands. There are just a few parts, so assembly, disassembly and cleaning is very easy. But the best part about the pump, is that you can buy different-sized breastshields to use with it. I needed a larger one than what came standard with it. It makes pumping more comfortable. The first few times I used it, I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn't pumping much milk. But the more I pumped, the more milk I produced. This breastpump is worth every penny. I recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds, but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby.	pos
We got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one.  We love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside.  It still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric.  We also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there.  We don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us.  Highly recommend! 	pos
Murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels. He was brought to the Island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line.

The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!"  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.   ---  --- A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clichï¿½.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.   ---  --- Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.  Enough said there. ---  --- My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.'	neg

Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed.  I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several  years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professional-by-day \ GadgetFreak-by-night guy. ---  --- If you don't read anything else in my review please understand this: --- 1)  This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump. --- 2)  If you are NOT in the market for spending around $110 a month for a service plan (voice and data), you have no business with this phone. ---  --- This is a productiviy enhancer, it is not %100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day, this phone does the trick. ---  --- The battery life isn't that bad as I have this thing in its cradle (not included) during the day. ---  --- Screen is bright. --- The WiFi feature works beautifully. --- The 3G network is amazingly fast. --- Works flawlessly with my Exchange 2003 server.  (Active Sync is so easy to setup, a noob could do it.) ---  --- The only reason reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it can't make me a cocktail	pos

I've used the SD-YD250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. Overall, the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience. I've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough. It can also save a lot of money, provided you purchase the yeast in bulk (for example 2lb). The single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at American supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. Particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough. This takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza, and when the dough is refrigerated for later use, it tastes even better in my opinion. ---  --- Like most engineered products of our age, this one is full of cute features that add little value, or cause annoyance. ---  --- The yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best. If you use it, you (for the most part) create extra work for yourself because you'll have to clean it later.  ---  --- The dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use. They make a marginal difference in baking results. I only use the quick bake mode, which takes 2 hours to complete.  ---  --- Let's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings (easy to do given the many parameters you can set). You just push the reset or cancel button and start over, right? Nope, no such button exists. Then unplug the unit and plug it back in, right? Nope, the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages, so the unit remembers where it left off. Yes, but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes, and after 10 minutes it will forget, right? Nope, I tried this, too. The unit does indeed forget eventually, but it's more than 11 minutes. If you plug it back too early, the timer resets and you have to wait again. ---  --- To summarize, the hardware is excellent, and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber	pos
This is Bresson's greatest, and last, work.  It is a work from a true cinematic auteur.  No one made films like Bresson did, and I don't think anyone ever will.  This film is based on a short story by Tolstoy entitled The Forged Coupon (aka The Forged Note), except Tolstoy's story is much different that Bresson's take here.  It is about how a forged note of 500 francs passes from one hand to another, ruining the life of a fuel oil delivery man.  Bresson made this film when he was 82, but you couldn't tell that it was made by a man that old.  Quite often, critics assume that filmmakers (and artists in general) have nothing to say as they get older.  On the contrary.  They have even more to say.  A real artist's vision deepens as they grow older.  Kurosawa made Ran at 75, and Eastwood made Million Dollar Baby at 74.  Those are their best films.  Bresson is rather feisty and combative (which is a good thing) in the interviews presented here.  He doesn't mince words, and he doesn't seem interested in doing the usual inane questions that featurettes on DVD's usually have from bubble headed reporters (even though these were shot for French TV, not Entertainment Tonight).  He has something to say.  This is my favorite film of his (even though Lancelot of the Lake and Au Hasard Balthazar are close behind).  Sadly, he never made another one after this, but the 13 he did make are all brilliant.  Not one bad one.  Great film, great man... --- 	pos
I was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch Live 8 and certainly regretted that. However, I was fortunate enough to find this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and more.

I would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation--truly a "must have" for anyone's collection! 	pos
I have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and I find it to be accurate, but it takes a while for it to give a reading. The first few times I used it, it took over a minute to tell me my pulse. However, the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster. So far, this is true, as within the last 3 days, I have received readings within 10 seconds consistently. Considering the price, it was a good purchase	pos
The dynamic Root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children's comedy.  My advice to Root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash.

I think Taylor Root is still a virgin	neg

When funds were tight I had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep.  Each women's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing, though with increased competition, these styles seem to be in flux.  I finally decided that I  preferred the writing in Bazaar and was getting tired of what I felt was Vogue's Cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership (if I want to subscribe to Cosmo, I'll bloody well subscribe).  The featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in Vogue.  It's a bit snottier (though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions).  Among my complaints: Bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine, and while most of Vogue's content is adverts, it does seem to have more articles.  Another item that I find highly irritating, is Bazaar's society items.  I really don't give a ---- who is wearing what at what charity gala, especially when I don't play footsies with these people.  Those complaints aside, this is still my favorite fashion magazine	pos
This product is phenomenal.  It reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly.  It worked under my wetsuit.  It works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming.

I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand	neg

I'm on my 5th cap now I think.  Silicone is great and lasts forever.  Unlike rubber (which can snag hair) and latex (which some people are allergic to) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair, has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn't lose elasticity. I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I've learned overt the years: --- 1. Always rinse and hang dry.  I've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect, it develops black spots. I don't know if it's mold, it doesn't wash off...and you'll have to buy a new cap if you don't like the spotted look. --- 2. Pull it on gently.  I've ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it. It's not cloth so you have to be careful. This goes for latex and rubber, too. --- 3. Wet your hair first.  If your hair is dry when you put it on, you will trap air under the cap.  And since it's not a permeable material, the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside.   --- 4. Pick a fun color.   --- That's it.  Have a great swim	pos
I bought this book and also Last Night based upon the gushing reviews you see above.  Who are they kidding? The main character is a cad.  It is far from "a tour de force" in erotic anything. His short stories in Last Night are only marginally better. Your time is better spent with other authors	neg
Thank God that there is a full recording of this evening available on CD, because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert. Granted, they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from Stephen Sondheim. This is truly a Broadway event. The documentary, which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun, but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin. We who adored Sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety	pos

I am an African American woman with long, chemically relaxed hair. As a full-time undergraduate student, I cannot afford to visit the salon on a weekly basis. I purchased this flat iron on a whim at the market because my previous flat iron had recently shorted out (it was an older model with no swivel cord). I chose this flat iron because it was the same brand as my last one, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with its performance. I cannot say the same for this product.  ---  --- In retrospect, it does exactly what it claims to do, but nothing beyond that. With my previous flat iron, I could straighten and style my layered hair at the same time, which significantly cut the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure. Any attempts to style my hair were underwhelming to say the least. After using the flat iron, my hair looked fizzy and unkempt, and even a bit damaged. Any curls I managed to produce looked undefined and limp. It was by chance that I purchased a curling iron in addition to the flat iron, and was able to successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control serum.  ---  --- Needless to say, you won't be able to produce that "fresh from the salon" look with this flat iron, which is sadly exactly what I needed. I do not feel confident about my hair when stepping out of the house after using this product. If you don't use this tool for anything but sleek, straight looks and have a bottle of frizz serum handy, then this is a great product for you. While I am not happy with its results, it will have to do for now. I'll be saving for a better iron while praying that straightening AND curling my hair doesn't leave it severely damaged.	neg
I bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week. It works great. When I registered the unit on line I found that Magellan's website showed there were software updates for this unit (Roadmate 2000). I downloaded the update and after some difficulty I was able to perform the upgrade. I then found that the voice prompts no longer worked. I logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct. I verified all of my settings and finally called Magellan support. The support group was hard to understand (they are located in India) and were unable to help me. I asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say. They asked that I upgrade the unit again (although the screen showing the firmware and OS versions showed the new version numbers) but by this time I was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade. This unit did not ship with an A/C adapter. I asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he (Tom) informed me there was not. I asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues I might experience with this "upgrade" and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions. I asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 - 48 hours. I was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after I told him I thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations. He came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour. It is well over an hour and no call so far. I tried their Corp office and was routed by an ARU back to India. I called their Corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named Marti who would not connect me to management. She said she would send me to Quality Assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary. I spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected. I love the Magellan GPS units and I have three (Blazer 12, Explorist 210 and the Roadmate 2000) and each time I have had to call tech support I am very disappointed. I have to say I will not recommend their products to anyone else since I am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers.  ---  --- To be fair Tom (tech support) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time. However, until then I have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever. If my wife was not already used to the unit I would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer.  ---  --- In summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don't expect good customer service if you need Magellan's help. --- 	neg
The Bushnell Powerview 12x25 is a fine, small pocket-sized binocular.  Since my wife is an avid bird watcher, we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power.  Our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 Bushnell that we used for trips, so I researched, then bought this one from Amazon for her birthday.  She loves it.  The viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact, which makes it easy to pack for vacations, yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country.  We both highly recommend this, and other Bushnell products	pos
Vanilla Sky is either a disappointment when viewed against Indie Film standards, or a happily confusing lark when compared to the unending deluge of big budget / low-minded Hollywood that's released weekly. ---  --- On the plus side, we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind.

Like Memento or Barton Fink, people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it's over. ---  --- Also impressive is the fact that Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's famed pretty boys, spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask, or horribly disfigured. Not a role many other actors would jump to take. ---  --- On the down side, Vanilla Sky, (a re-make ?) is basically an Art House or Indie film starring a big Hollywood actor. What could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man, or alternate/multiple realities, or even a study on the nature of reality itself, instead ends up like an art house rip-off of Total Recall. ---  --- Rating: B- / C+ ---  --- FYI:  --- 1) When did the universe change so much that "Banky" from Chasing Amy could get a lead role playing opposite Tom Cruise? --- 2) When did Penelope Cruz get the role of Indecipherable Speaker, ala Brad Pitt in Snatch or Fenster in The Usual Suspects? --- 3) When did Paul McCartney last have a decent single?

I used to try to strengthen my fingers using the Gripp balls, and later, the  Gravity Gripp, which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights.  However, they were bulky, hard to get a grip on, and heavy and pretty silly looking.  So, when I saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog, I ordered one right away.  They are about the same price of the Grip balls, but they are SO much cooler!  Not only is this good for  fitness training, they're even better for musicians!  (my instrument is piano.)  These are light and flat and they fit right into a purse.    I don't feel silly using this out in public -- if anyone asks, I just let them try it, and they are immediately hooked.  I carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend, when I gave it away to a friend.   ---  --- It is difficult to know which tension to use.  I'm a woman with small hands, and found that I am right between the blue and the red.  I use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger (left hand).  I can usually handle the red one for everything else, but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension.  I use mainly the blue one now.  I hope to work up to the red, but that will be a while.  I'm also going to buy a couple more so I can work both hands simultaneously.   ---  --- I do have one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly. Don't overdo it, or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho.  Like any weight training, you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles.  Don't use your whole arm just to get the button pressed.  I found that if I started to cheat, I got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis.  (another reason I'm staying on the blue tension for now.) ---  --- Oh, and buy your Gripmaster here at Amazon.  They are $15 each everywhere else	pos
Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.

Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem	neg

These are the best berries I've ever tasted!  I thought for sure they were sweetened, but they're not.  The berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them.  Additionally, the slices are whole, with very little breakage in the can.  The value you get is pretty great, considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5# of fresh strawberries.  At $3/lb (+ shipping) that's really not bad, and you can have these year-round, even when strawberries aren't in season	pos

I concur with the review that points up the problems with Adobe's new "license manager" method of activation. When you pay as much as you do for this app, or the entire suite, you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems, or can't connect to the Internet from "location shooting." I took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic. ---  --- That said, this version of Photoshop is superb, an otherwise 5-star app. If you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help (used to be separate folders, with chapters 1 - 4 of the Classroom In A Book, but no more alas), or get one of Deke McClelland's fine tomes and do all the lessons, there is nothing in this app that the novice can't start to use from Day One. With today's point & shoot cameras packing more resolution, and more manual control, into their functions, use of Photoshop becomes more than just a hobby. You can really "rescue" photos that are too dark, too bright, exceedingly color-shifted, from the "cut" folder and still make prints. Further, the Camera RAW functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography. ---  --- A warning: you need the fastest processor you can afford (a Core Duo or Quatro will be superb), and as much RAM as your system can take. There is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM. You need AT LEAST that much under Windows XP to get good performance out of PS CS2. If you can use 2GB or more dual-channel memory, that's even better (the dual-channel RAM adds a small boost when handling large file sizes, e.g. Camera RAW image sources). If you don't have these, don't expect Photoshop to act fast.  ---  --- Adobe Bridge is a major improvement for this version. It offers superior file and image management functions, and can even do batch editing on images. You can even perform Camera RAW adjustments right from Bridge. Bridge can perform batch processes WHILE YOU EDIT IN PHOTOSHOP. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. If you doubt me, check out Deke McClelland's PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE tutorial for his chapter on using Adobe Bridge. His video introduction (included on a DVD in the book), and chapter on using and customizing Bridge, are terrific introductions. ---  --- If you're a user of versions 5.x (as I was), 6, or 7, upgrading to CS2 is a no-brainer. Don't wait. Get it now before the Adobe License Manager gets worse in 2007	pos
I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies.	neg
I can understand that Robin felt a need to include some of the biggest Bee Gees hits to appease the fans, but the ones that were sung by Barry are below wretched here.  Robin frequently disappears in the sound mix, becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony.  That's fine for a group concert, like the Bee Gees, but inexcusable for a solo effort.  His stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act.  They should have kept this in the can.  It seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for Robin. Don't do him the favor	neg

This is a great case! I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didn't line up.  Because this is a flip phone, most cases move when you open and shut the phone, covering speakers, etc.  This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement, when you open and close the phone, doesn't affect the placement of the holes, etc. in the case.  Also, the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent. 	pos
Having struggled with digital scales that broke after a few years, I finally decided to get the scale my doctor has.  It's terrific because I can see it clearly (the numbers are right in my face) and it is built to last forever! My daughter and I assembled it with a minimum of effort. The directions are written clearly and all adjustments are super easy to handle. It is clearly the best scale I've ever owned.  The down side is that it needs a bit more space than a regular floor scale.  You can, however, buy a piece of plywood and put the scale on top of the wood in a carpeted room if your bathroom can't handle the bigger size	pos
I found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women.  Men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule.  The authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.  I suggest anyone who reads this books should also read "Discovering Biblical Equality."  It gives another view of how the Christians world see the role of women	neg

Be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever.  Can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step.  I was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one.  I searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the Apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive.  Talk about crazy! 	neg
Hi Folks, ---  --- the movies all look very good..and there are a nice group  of bonus features from vintage featurettes to  commentaries!  On  Macao...I particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with Jane Russell and  Robert Mitchum  that Robert Osborne conducted...very late in the life of Mr Mitchum.  The packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great Robert Mitchum at under $10 each on DVD w/bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal! ---  --- The movies aren't generally considered Mitchum's best or best known but when you consider you've got Jean Simmons as a costar and Otto Preminger directing Angel Face,  Josef Von  Sternberg helming  Macao, Vincent Minnelli directing HOme From The Hill, The great Fred Zinneman directing and the legend Deborah Kerr co-starring in the Sundowners ...you can figure this isn't the bottom of  the barrel either!  Oh and Sydney Pollack directed The Yakuza and contributes a great commentary.... ---  --- To  sum up...warner Bros...continues to deliver THE VERY BEST classic titles on  DVD with the best combination of quality transfers/bonus features and value packages!!!! --- 	pos

This is absolutely the greatest shampoo ever! I've been abusing my hair for at least 30 years, and I have never had my hair looking and feeling as healthy as it does now. There is no better product for your hair on the market. All others are full of damaging detergents and chemicals with a dose of silicone thrown in to make you think your hair is clean, but you're killing it. I admire Jonathan for not treating us like idiots by being THE ONLY shampoo that doesn't tell you to lather, shampoo, and rinse twice, but you do need to. And you need to use no more than a dime-size amount of the Jonathan conditioner. My hair has never looked or felt so good	pos

This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son's only high chair.  I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair.  However, I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything.  I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage.  Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go, he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair.  If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don't have a climber - this is the chair for you, but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs	pos

I purchased this magazine solely to get cheaper access to ESPN Insider Online.  The magazine is so all over the place otherwise that its hardly worth reading.

Don't expect SI-type depth though, its full of ads and slick factoid type departments.  Reading this magazine is like watching Sportscenter, a lot of many little things with no depth on anything.  I guess its worth it for less than 60 cents an issue, but if I sat down to read this magazine cover to cover I would be done with it totally in under 15 minutes....enjoy	neg
I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate. ---  --- Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective. ---  --- If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240. --- 	neg

We purchased the crib, armoire, & dresser w/ tower & it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's "cheaper" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again.	neg
I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels great.  I personally like the COPPER version a little better than the SILVER version.  It's a little gentler and softer but I know some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are fragil and I would risk damaging them.  It also feels really good on the back and actually all over, not just on the head	pos
Don't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs. We bought the Bratz one & it thought it was a Pawz when we took it online.

I ordered this for Christmas from a Marketplace Seller. It was defective and assumed I would have to deal directly with Philips to get a replacement. After seven weeks, I still do not have a replacement from them; their customer service people keep telling me 10-15 days, and I have no recourse. I also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if I could, or even get the unit. I would not recommend buying this or any other Philips product to anyone. Their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. I also had to pay the shipping to return their defective DVD player	neg
I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope. It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked.

I cannot believe Radio Flyer put this bike out!

After some resistance, they agreed to refund me and they did. --- The back wheels are too close together, making it very easy to tip over, plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable.  I tried it too in the store on smooth ground, but on the sidewalk, forget it!   --- Please save yourself the trouble! --- 	neg
I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat.  We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests (TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle). ---  --- Compared to our still-new Safety 1st seat, this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways: ---  --- 1) The base is super easy to install.  Click twice into each of the car's two anchor points, then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base.  That's it.  Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn't leave me as confident as this one. ---      --- 2) The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby's head (no flopping).  Our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels. ---      --- 3) The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows.  No such system on our old seat. ---      --- 4) The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right. ---      --- 5) If the base is not available, the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car's lap belt. ---      --- 6) The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat, allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room.  Every inch helps. ---      --- 7) The seat is lighter than our old seat, although it feels just as secure  and solid as the old one. ---      --- All this, and the seat is the same price as our old one.  Unfortunately Amazon/Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out, but I found them in stock online at Wally World, if you are looking to get one quickly.  The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally's, unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design. ---  --- Summary: super easy to install and adjust, well thought-out features, fair price!  Makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these :	pos

I purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my R818 camera (the dock has a thin port, roughly 10 connectors) while the R818 has a mini USB plug). ---  --- HP was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter, getting a different answer each time I spoke to a different rep (even being told at one point that no supervisors were working).  I was finally able to get someone willing to send me one, but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it, which by then I'll be on vacation (and I purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter, thinking it was not hard to get).  I was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation. ---  --- I would definately *not* recommend this if you have the Photosmart R818 digital camera, unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get a correct part, and waiting 10+ business days to get it	neg
The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.  ---  --- The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.  ---  --- I recently discovered Tazo Teas ad have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have been impressed.

My wife bought me this for me a couple years ago. I think she had an ulterior motive: for me to make the Thanksgiving turkey when all of her family came to visit. I did, and it was simply outstanding! I have done several turkeys, chickens, and roasts on this rotisserie and they all turned out perfect with very little effort. If you have a 22.5-inch Weber kettle, you need this rotisserie	pos
Talentless people and garbage music  torture you in this turkey-in no time flat,you'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming "MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" out into the yard.Do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense	neg
My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift, and I have to admit she loves it, but it has nothing to do with the product design. She would love any toy shopping cart at this stage. She just loves pretend cooking, eating, and feeding her baby doll.  ---  --- This toy is so shoddily made it's laughable. Some of the included foods to put in the cart are actually just cardboard boxes that wind up torn and in the garbage within the first 48 hours. The cart basket is too small, the baby gets stuck in the seat, and my daughter gets frustrated when parts of the cart fall off as she plays. It's not going to last long. The best parts are the little milk carton and the banana. ---  --- Check out other shopping cart toys (little tykes or small world toys).  We bought her a set of wooden fruit (melissa and doug). When this shopping cart dies, we'll buy her a sturdy one and add more wooden food toys (there are some excellent sets available). My advice is skip this one and buy your child something better the first time around	neg
It's soo cute and cuddly! Not only is extra soft, it's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great addition to a desk. It looks realistic too, it had the little cat fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable, the only downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure you take out the "TY" tag otherwise you would end up with heart shape marks on your face=	pos
Nice bracelet for the price. Good for gifts for friends (which is what I purchased them for) Everyone was very happy with them	pos

  I bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price.

Yes, T&C is the oldest continually published magazine in the USA, and it's their 160th anniversary. However, I see little reason to celebrate.  Why? Because I fail to see how it's really improved over the years.  ---  --- Nowadays, this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the "nouveau riche". Back in the day when it was a true "high society" magazine, there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts, literature and culture. It was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to, but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about "bling bling", so has this magazine.   ---  --- There are far too many adverts for so-called "luxury goods" for my tastes, and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new "power" base, they insist on using only THIN 20-something models who probably can't afford the clothes they are modeling! ---  --- Articles wise, they are starting to sound more like Glamour or Cosmo than the erudite publication I used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago.  ---  --- Yes, T&C has changed with the times...but these are not good times if that is the case. It's too bad	neg
I, too, experienced the "Blue Screen of Death" on my laptop which has XP pro on it.  I had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting.

The foot massager is great. It's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like. The massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit. The massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt, raise/lower and etc. The only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it. So keeping it upright can be a bit challenging. But for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet	pos
I can't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible. ---  --- PROBLEMS:  ---  --- 1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory. --- 2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks.  --- 3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week. --- 4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing. --- 5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said " don't know."  ---  --- Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer.  ---  --- My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at "stadium seating" strollers.	neg

Anthony Hopkins is absolutely riveting as Adolf Hitler.  He captures all of Hitler's mannerisms, quirks, and facial expressions.  My only complaint is that he doesn't use a German accent.  The production is poor, and there are some flaws in the story.  For example, Albert Speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film.  It has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by Speer.  The guy who plays Joseph Goebbels is horrible, one of the worst acting jobs I've seen.  But overall the acting is great, and the performance by Hopkins makes this movie worth owning	pos
I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16	neg
Despite what the other reviewer has said, this table is great. I delpoyed to Iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems. The table is lightweight, and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly. I use it for my laptop indoors, but outdoors it works great as well (provided a hurricane isn't trying to blow it around) Overall, it's a great table that's compact and easy to set up and break down. My only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams. I'd buy another if I had the need for one, and everyone in Iraq has complimented me on it because they're stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on.	pos
This is the only tripod that I have ever owned, however, I do agree that it seems to be a very nice piece of equipment, especially for the very low price. It suits my needs well for a small digital camera. The only downside is that it does not come with a carry bag. This was an oversight on my part when I ordered, and I'm sure I would have to pay just as much as I did for the tripod to get a bag for it, so I will live with it as is	pos
Less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the Self with no spectators and no judges. The book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy	neg
I was again disappointed as this did not make me feel "fresh".  In fact if you mix it with the Dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it. 	neg
Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great. 	pos
It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job	pos

OK, the advertisements are a bit much, but the magazine is great. My son has subscriptions to Cricket and Kids Discover, too. He has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years, and this one stands out to me because, unprompted, he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing. This magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all. The magazine format is easy to read, yet rich in content	pos
I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on. ---  --- Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun.  ---  --- Here are some of the beneficial features: ---  --- -Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like. ---  --- -You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze. ---  --- -Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time. ---  --- -It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature. ---  --- -As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool. ---  --- Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.	pos
The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths. ---  ---  Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL	neg

My three sons and I saw these pogos demonstrated at the Cleveland X Games a couple years ago.  We could not beleive what we saw.  This is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen.

For adults (yes, adults will love this thing!)or kids this is a "must have" this Christmas.

I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.   --- For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to. --- So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist	neg
I agree with the two previous reviewers.  There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  This isn't very helpful for star gazing.  The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together	neg
I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety	pos
I was reading about my son.  It all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  Really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  All of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  When it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present. ---  --- The authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which I would have respected, if not agreed with.  Then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes Christ into the conversation/solution.  If I knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, I wouldn't have spent the $22.  I would have wanted to know that in advance.  Tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book. ---  --- Buyer Bewar	neg

I should preface this reveiw with the fact that I am an accomplished home cook.  I have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks.  I do not buy commercially prepared products like breads, crackers, mayonnaise or salad dressings.  I make these items myself.  I suspect that I am not the target audience for this publication. ---  --- The May/June 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total.  Given that there are only 6 issues a year, I was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages. ---  --- The May/June 2006 issue contains the following information: ---  --- Simplifying Moroccan Chicken --- Bringing Home Fish and Chips --- Grilled Tomato Salsa --- Grilled London Broil --- Main-dish Vegetable Stir-fries --- How to cook pasta --- Foolproof Veal Scaloppini --- A new Twist on Chicken Salads --- Garlic and Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes --- Utimate Turtle Brownies --- Best Strawberry Cream Cake --- The Scoop on Vanilla Ice Cream --- A review of tongs ---  --- If you are an experienced cook their isn't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you.  This issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking.  However, I enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful. ---  --- This magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook.  Bottom line, I will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little "more meat" in their content.  I think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive.  I would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their "Best of" cookbook instead.  It costs about the same amount, contains many more recipes, has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer.  Additionally, check out an issue of "Fine Cooking" which is another test kitchen type of publication, just with more depth. 	neg
I bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother, who is impossible to please.  She needed a new card shuffler, as she wasn't pleased with her plastic, battery operated one.  I must admit, I thoroughly expected to have to return it, since I knew she wouldn't be pleased with it.  As it turns out, I did have to return it, but here's the surprise.  I was very disappointed in its performance too!  We could not get it to shuffle cards, whether they be from a new deck, or an old, worn out, dog eared deck.  Moral of this story -- please don't buy this item, whether you're difficult to please or not	neg
Back to Nature Apple Strawberry Granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack. Each flavor of the Back to Nature Granola is tasty. ---  --- I would be careful before ordering this product in bulk. My order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on September 15th. I did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had I known this. As this is a food product it is not eligible for return. ---  --- So while this is an excellent product, I would not recommend ordering this from Amazon Grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire	pos
I know all this stuff seems like a good idea but have we forgotten GHB? That was supposedly the fountain of youth a few years ago and now no one hardly even talks about it. Let me let you in on a little secret, GHB turned out to be a very addictive substance and in fact a handy little trick to get a girl naked without any problems like dinner movie or even her knowing you for that matter. Like HGH, everyone jumped on it before all the data was in. Please put your money away and be safe. A pretty face isn't worth the trouble this could potentially cause. And lets be realistic at 60 you really won't ever look 20 again and the weight you would have lost will be the money leaving your pocket book and not the fat from your thighs. Work out, do yoga, and eat a healthy vegetarian diet and you can't go wrong. Also, when i stopped eating sugar the cellulite also disappeared and so did those extra pounds	neg

I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an "indoor walk" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout	neg

The other day I used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. The whole time I found myself missing the manual zoom, instant response and convient manual buttons on my D50. This camera takes amazing pictures. As an dSLR beginner I used the camera in Auto mode for the first several weeks, now after reading some books on photography I'm slowing starting to use the manual features. The D50 lets me choose the level of control that I'm comfortable with, from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away. ---  --- The body of this camera is built like a tank. Metal and high quality plastics abound. The buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable. It is a beautiful piece of precision engineering	pos
I don't see how they can compare these guys to The Mars Volta or Coheed and Cambria. I can hear the prog elements but it's more of a Rush kind of prog rock,shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics. They are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band: the songs just aren't as epic as a TMV or a C&C song. I think reviewers liken Brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice. This is still an amazing album that is well worth your time. Go into it expecting Sparta rather than The Mars Volta and you won't be disappointed	pos
This case is made for an L6. The L2 uses the same case, so they both fit within this rubber case. However, the keys are laid out differently on the L6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. I didn't give it a low rating, because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give  other L2 owners a warning. It works well, but it's just a little funky on an L2, but totally usable. For the price, you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket	pos

I am a computer repair tech and I can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs. You should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your OS. Most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that, double installs. PLEASE PLEASE ..remove/uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls. then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like CCleaner to remove leftover registry keys, then reboot again and then and only then install your new Antivirus/Security program. I have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system, it works great. A very good product at a very good price. I can't comment on it's tech support, I have never used it	pos

I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off. it fell apart after 1 hour. it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made. those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it	neg
This shelter met all my expectations.  I would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it.  Being so large, it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise.  I had mine setup on a raised deck, so the sandbags were a life saver!  Overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents!  The storage bag is outstanding too... with nice wheels and a handle - it is easy to transport!  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large	pos
For all you non-believers out there, BUY THIS GAME! I was like you...reading the reviews, looking at the box in various stores, pondering, considering, thinking to myself, "should I buy this game?" Now that I finally spent the mere $20 and played the game, I am wondering why I didn't do so sooner. As an avid Playstation supporter, (Stood in line for hours and paid over $600 for my PS2 back in the day), this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment. Cinematically driven storyline, supurbly coordinated character control, creative levels and character design, great soundtrack, decent bosses, pretty cool power moves, and, (importantly), puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the TV screen...except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns. In closing, all I gotta say is the same thing I said my first sentence of this review...BUY THIS GAME	pos
I work in a bank where every year each of the branches does a stupid secret Santa thing around Christmas time.

I first encountered Bird3 opening for Veruca Salt the summer of 2001.  That band had put their faith into Bird and so have I.  We fell in love with them all together.  This band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique, beautiful, and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today.  You'll find yourself not only humming along, but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments.  You will not once regret buying this piece of art	pos
The only song I know with a 12-string electric in it is Rush's Xanadu, so I let 'er rip.  Sounded good.  I had alot of fun playing around with it.  However, after an hour or so of goofing around I noticed two things that really ticked me off.  Firstly, the outer tines had already broken.  The tines look like a wound steel guitar string, but the core is very brittle.  They didn't completely fall off, they just hung there like limp whatevers.  Secondly, the plastic p'up cover and pick guard looked like they had been scrubbed with a wire brush.  I can easily fix those, but I wonder what such an abrasive pick will do to the strings if I play it alot.  It looks like you can only strum on the down stroke.  Videos of the jellyfish website confirm this.  The problem is you're going against the grain on the upstroke and it catches on the strings.  How much fun is it to only play down strokes?  It's kind of hard grasp, too.  It needs a thumb dimple. ---  --- I'm going to make one using more flexible wound guitar stings to see if its any better. ---  --- If you've got $10 to blow, go ahead and get one	neg

I had purchased the Dr. Brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness.  They did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most.  By this point, both babies had become attached to these bottles and wouldn't use anything else.  ---  --- At first I thought I must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak, and sometimes POUR out of the rim of the bottle. (I have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles, none this bad!) We tried Everthing to stop the leaks -  --- *using only all dry parts for each new bottle --- *not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside --- *not overfilling ---  --- After an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles I noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple, that milk would come pouring down the sides!  Finally, the answer to the leaks!!!   ---  --- Is truly a great idea and I hope they try to perfect it, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun.  These items were meant for baby use, and for the price  it should help make babies' & mom's life easier. ---  --- Stick with Avent or Playtex with liners.  Thank you & Good Luck	neg

ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.  I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny	pos

The ring and motor do what they are supposed to do.  The ring did not fit very well, at first, it was able to rock back and forth.  However, after a little bending into shape, it fit more snug.  The way the ring rests on the kettle, there will alway be some gap, which does not allow for a good seal.  I not only use this as a rotisserie, but also to give me more room for beer can chicken.  Its worth getting it for the added flexibility.	pos

this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.  Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness.  ---  --- The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing. ---  --- Niggles: --- 1. Camera is slow and not very clear, but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either. --- 2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own. --- 3. Need more menu choices.  The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around. --- 4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint)	pos
Shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways, but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability, which, to me, is absolutely awful! ---  --- Personally, I hate zoom lenses. I've got a full set of Nikon primes. And while I'd prefer a prime lens, these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr. ---  --- I like this lens because it goes WIDE on digital. I suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives. ---  --- For anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end, unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time, 2mm is a SIGNIFICANT difference in field of view on short lenses. As the focal length increases (eg, from 400mm to 600mm), the difference in angle of view is not very large. But the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though "only 2mm" is no laughing matter, and if you don't believe me, you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself. ---  --- If you end up deciding to get a 12mm, you want to buy the sigma 12mm (I think it is 12-24mm?) because that lens covers full 35mm frame (and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing)! ---  --- Also, if Sigma or Nikon reads this review, please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime! ---  --- And if Sigma reads this review, I want some f1.2 or f1.0 AFD primes! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length! I would definitely buy (full frame coverage of course) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele! Neither Nikon nor Canon makes anything like that (well, canon kind of does/did), so you'd have the market segment dominated	pos
After opening the weather station and setting it up, I noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing "characters".  I contacted Amazon and returned it.  Within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem.  When I contacted them again, they would not replace it again, saying that the "batch" they have must be defective.  I was not aware that Amazon was selling the "seconds" from other retailers.  A phone call to LaCrosse remedied the situation.  They advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace/repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises.  They further advised the "fail ratio" with the problem I had with both units is less than 1%.  Beware if buying this from Amazon	neg

I bought this game about a week ago. I had not purchased the prequil (sp?) to this game and did not know what to expect.  --- I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30-45 minutes later. I have no played the game since. Here's why: --- The graphics, to me, are ridiculously annoying. It makes the game feel so unrealistic. The graphics are a step lower than "NBA Street" and even more unrealistic. The real problem is that there is just nothing to do. You enter tournements and they all feel the same. The little side missions are laughable, and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them.  --- I can go on and on about why I hated this game. But I won't. The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money. The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game...but don't let that happen to you	neg

A remarkable introduction to Ezra Pound.  Makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the Cantos--periplous, ideogram, fugue, the 'repeat in history'--and gives concise readings of individual sections  that helped my understanding enormously.  He does an especially good job of  connecting Pound's theory of money to his views on sex and creativity.   Makin manages to be critical of Pound while treating his ideas with verve  and sympathy;  the writing is colloquial, witty and jargon-free.  I enjoyed  the Cantos much more after reading this short, effective study	pos

I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called "Thin Fire Wire". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money. ---  --- Shame on you Sony	neg
  The grill is up to Webers usual high standards but I do have a couple of quibbles with it.  I bought the Q grill because I needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv.  Since every pound counts, the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel.  But an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface.  I don't have the time nor inclination to "season" a cast iron grill.  What I would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface	neg
I recently purchased the GoFit 40lb weighted vest, and it's everything I hoped it would be. I was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts, and this vest has proved to be a good choice. The weight is balanced well between front and back of my body. The shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks. The velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement. I have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting, though it does hamper some bending movements. The weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter. I am well pleased with my purchase	pos

While not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as Coldplay, Keane, and Pete Yorn, Travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound. This, their 2nd album, is the best of their music: melodic throughout, with catchy tunes, solid lyrics, and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'Sing' to the fade-out from 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song'. ---  --- If you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent, then I confidently recommend The Invisible Band to you.  ---  --- Rating each song individually for one's ipod:  --- 1. Sing, Side, The Cage, Afterglow and the Humpty Dumpty Love Song are each worthy of four to five stars --- 2. Pipe Dreams, Flowers in the Window, Safe, Follow the Light, and Indefinitely are three to four star songs --- 3. The balance are two to three stars each. The only poor effort is probably "Last Train", which is too plodding relative to its counterparts ---  --- The Invisible Band is basically a healthy mix of folksy, hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy. Nowhere is this better reflected than in 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song', which defines this mix perfectly. While this is the best of the album, the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly.  Highly recommended	pos

I didn't read in the instructions that I was also buying a dancing partner.  This thing just *will not* stay still.  I tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors, but the water weight just isn't enough to keep it still.  Power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket.  If I lived in an apartment, my neighbors would hate me.   ---  --- The water ends up around 200lbs (when full) and just doesn't do the trick.  I have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs, but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water. ---  --- As for springiness, you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it (by moving across the floor), but in my opinion it's TOO springy.  There is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag.  It definitely needs a tension adjustment. ---  --- I'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control.  I wouldn't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power-hitting	neg
I am hopeful that Katie Holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a Stepford wife for her couch-jumping husband-to-be. It's not that she strikes me as all that brilliant, but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as April Burns, a rebellious twenty-something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family's upstate home to a tenement in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Encouraged by her new boyfriend Bobby (who happens to be black), she invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment. There is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst-driven mother is dying of breast cancer, and this may be their last meal together ---  --- Directed and written by Peter Hedges (who wrote the equally eccentric "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"), the story bounces back and forth between April's hazard-ridden preparation of the meal and the Burns family's chaotic journey to the city. While the family trip will remind you somewhat of this year's "Little Miss Sunshine", April's adventure consists mainly of meeting her motley neighbors, all strangers at first, to borrow a working stove for her turkey. Among others, she runs into a friendly black couple, an obsessive vegan and an elderly Chinese couple whom she teaches the origins of the holiday. On top of this is an odd, racially-driven storyline involving Bobby's need to buy a suit while being pursued by some suspicious characters. ---  --- Shot in digital video by Tami Reiker and running only eighty minutes, the 2003 movie works toward an inevitable conclusion, but Hedges adds enough filmmaking idiosyncrasies to make it all seem more intriguing than it has any right to be. Among the supporting cast, Patricia Clarkson stands out as April's mother Joy, bringing a steely resolve as she crumbles under the surface. Oliver Platt is terrific as her put-upon husband Jim, as are Derek Luke as Bobby and Allison Pill as April's "perfect" little sister Beth. In little more than cameos which could have been excised, Sean Hayes plays a neurotic neighbor with a new stove and a pampered dog, while Dru Hill's Sisqo plays Bobby's friend Latrell. Hedges provides a nice commentary track on the 2004 DVD, which also includes a fifteen-minute making-of featurette	pos

I love this watch!  It's easy to use.  It's also a very basic watch.  It gives your heart rate, zone and calories burned.  It's very nice for what it is supposed to do.

The only reason I would have gotten the F6 is because it says it has something that prevents "cross talk" (interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch.  There are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we've never had a problem with "cross talk."  As the other reviews said, there is no backlight.  Would recommend	pos

I looked everywhere for a plastic durable toybox, seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything in stock to look at in person. I took a chance on this one because the price was right, and I'm very pleased. I like the pockets on the front, my son loves putting his books in & out. If I would change one thing it is the lid. It is lightweight as to not hurt little hands & fingers (which is good), but is never locked onto the toybox, it lifts off very easily, so sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow indentations it sits in. Other than that we love it	pos

Zig Ziglar has done it again. As an author myself of sales books,  I realize sales is about so much more than just having the 'gift of gab,' and fast talking. It's about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers. It's about not just being a consultant to others, but being a consultant to yourself. It's recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is. Zig's theories exemplify this.	pos
We needed a way to haul three adult-sized bicycles from our home base to various cycling paths. So I visited a number of local stores to see what my options were. I settled on the Yakima BigHorn 4 as the best option for my budget, then discovered through some online searching that I could purchase the next model up, the Yakima KingPin 4 bike rack for a bit less than the BigHorn 4 would run me in a traditional retailer. ---  --- The KingPin 4 folds features a fold-down mast, a must convenience to allow access to a vehicle's rear hatch or door. Although I would not consider a bike rack without this feature, be forewarned: once you lower the rack while it's loaded with three bikes (more about the fourth bike claim follows), you will be hard pressed to single-handedly reposition it and slide in the lock or bolt. There is too much weight on that pivot point.  ---  --- I soon learned, therefore, that it was easier to have the mast folded up, not down, when loading the bikes.  ---  --- The dual bike arms are a must, allowing for more stability and easier loading and unloading. The bike arms fold down as well, though this option, while useful, is not essential in many cases. (These folding bike arms are the main difference between the KingPin and BigHorn racks.) ---  --- A series of bike cradles and rubber "chainstraps" stabilize and anchor the bikes. You can slide theses cradles along the tubular arms to allow sufficient room to avoid any rubbing or scraping if you are carrying three bikes. (I looked as some less expensive racks that required hand-tightening one or more big bolts to tighten clamps that held the bikes. That system seemed like a royal pain and huge annoyance.) ---   --- Despite the name and billing, I'm less confident in recommending the KingPin4 for transporting four bikes. I think it's possible, but would require great care to avoid scraping paint or entangling pedals and spokes. Plus, I prefer using four "chainstraps" per bike for a bit of insurance, so if you want to carry four bikes, I would recommend springing for another set of these.  ---  --- The unloaded contraption weights about 32 pounds, so it's not too heavy as you carry it from the basement or garage to install it. But be careful of the arms or you might shatter the glass in a door or an outside light. Also, you need to do a bit of assembly out of the box, so allow a good 30 minutes to set up and test the rig before using it the first time. The drawings in the instructions did not seem to match what I was actually looking at when I had everything before me on the floor, so I spent an extra few minutes considering the options. This assembly is not difficult---it's just that adage "never do anything for the first time" may stump one for a bit.   ---  --- I am using this rack with a two-inch hitch, and I purchased a locking pin to replace the bolt that is shipped for attaching the rack to the hitch. I also run one of the cable bike locks through the bike frames and around the spanner between the arms to add a measure of security.  ---  --- During our first foray, a 100-mile trip each way, the bikes and rack swayed just a bit from time to time, but overall, the sway was not a problem. Having a hundred extra pounds jutting up behind the rear window will change any vehicle's handling and hamper visibility through the rearview mirror, so be prepared to change your driving style as needed.  ---  --- To conclude, the KingPin 4 has performed well. We could load and unload three bikes in about five minutes, and neither the Durango or bikes were scratched during transport. But, again, I would suggest that this rack is great for three bikes, but may be a challenge for carrying four.  ---  ---  --- 	pos
This book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing...his book is mostly life-stories...and stupid ones at that...some teeter the line of racism, he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil "fat black woman" and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book, i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on "race".  --- And besides that, his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired...and there is no "self-initiation" for the type of Voodoo he's talking about... ---  --- i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money, i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing. If you looking to learn about Voodoo or Vodun this book will not help.  ---  --- His title is also misleading because "Voodoo" ussually refers to Hoodoo and "Vodun" ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one....he's just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life-experiences are even worth tellin. ---  --- This book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back-ground to African based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much.....this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about	neg

I gave birth to a premature infant that had to spend a week in the NICU.  Because of that I was forced to establish my milk supply w/ a breastpump.  The morning after I gave birth my husband went Walmart to pick up some of things that we hadn't purchased.  I called him crying and told him that he had to find something for my sore nipples.  Well this is what he brought back.  The relief was instantaneous. I bought a couple more boxes as my daughter "learned" to breastfeed.

Whenever I'm asked what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I quickly respond, "Cabin Boy." It is like a long, meandering, and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker. I would describe the plot, but there is none. I watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline, but it never came. It was written by a former staff writer for David Letterman, which is the only conceivable reason that Letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity. Even he later joked about how awful the movie was. Chris Elliott plays the only character he has ever played--the annoyimg dumb guy loser. His limited acting talent, combined with a nonsensical plot, unfunny dialogue, and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor, truly make Cabin Boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss	neg
I bought this movie for my husband because its one of his faves.  When we received it we found out it was a Blu Ray edition and our DVD player doesn't accept Blu Ray DVD's.  So I basically bought a movie I can't watch.  It should have been put in the description that this a Blu Ray edition for those of us who don't have Blu Ray compatible dvd players	neg
After receiving the case and trying to use it on the camera, I discovered it was very cumbersome and almost impossible to manipulate.  For instance, you cannot access the CF card or camera with the attached portion screwed into the tripod mount, Also, taking the front cover off to take a picture was a hassle.  This is not useable for a carry-around use. ---  --- I have it sitting in the corner of my office unused, spent good money for nothing.	neg
And I am not just talking about weight loss products.  I took one pill....ONE PILL!  Within a few minutes, I was curled up around the toilet crying because I needed to throw up so badly but I couldn't.  I hadn't drunk anything but one glass of water with it, and yet, I was peeing all day.  I was nauseus....my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me.  I didn't want to move, but I would have to go to the bathroom to pee, and would carry around a trash can with me just in case I finally could throw up.  I would not wish these symptoms on ANYONE, not even my worst enemy.  That was probably the worst sickness I have ever had	neg

Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching' periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane spectrum. Track #2, "I Love You" finds him playing furious, cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very realistic look at a genius in motion	pos

The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression	neg

It clearly says it is a MESH dress! I wore this for my wedding, outside in bright sunlight, and it certainly did not show everything, but do not expect it to be completely opaque, as it is a MESH dress with delicate lining. ---  --- As for the quality, it wore well, and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design. Very fairy-like and pretty, and I was pleased to wear it	pos
I bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same.  Other covers I've seen just slip on, this one has to be tied on.  Also, it doesn't cover the entire cart.

In theory this is a nice set, and I like all of the different tools -- but I bought this as a gift, and I'm going to return it.  It just looks too cheap.

Perhaps if I was buying them for myself I wouldn't mind, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift	neg

I've been using the stainless steel weber grates for a few weeks now, having replaced the old porcelain ones. I think the heating is quicker, more event, and perhaps even more absorbing for the items on the grill. Not sure if that makes sense, but it seems that the foods seem to heat through adequately in a shorter amount of time without getting overcooked. I do tend to keep the burners down low and turn the cover down on almost everything I cook. I'm a little disappointed that the grates don't stay shiny stainless steel, even in the areas on which I don't lay down foods. I guess that's because of all the heat swirling around when I have the cover closed. All in all, I give this a hearty recommendation	pos
I first smelled this perfume on a colleague of mine, about a year ago. Every time she walked by me I got a whiff of this heavenly scent that she wore nearly every day. So, I finally stopped her and asked what she was wearing. I'd never heard of it, so I jumped online and looked it up, found a bottle and bought it. I couldn't wait to try it out, so when the perfume finally arrived I put it right on. Imagine my disappointment when I smelled a scent totally unlike the one I'd experienced. On me it was overpoweringly musky, nothing like the seductive fragrance I'd smelled on my colleague. But, an odd thing happened. I didn't wash it right off, and when I smelled it again about 30 minutes later it had become the alluringly sensual perfume I'd fallen in love with. In fact, the longer I wore it the better it smelled. Obviously it depends on your body chemistry to achieve it's bloom. Now, I wear it when I go out in the evenings, and people comment on how wonderfully sexy it smells. If you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly, as I did....give it a little time and you're sure to love it. You only need to use a little, and it lasts for HOURS.	pos
I bought this software to print my Christmas cards and much to my dismay, it did not print properly on my HP inkjet printer. I tried various settings with the same bad results and finally had to contact tech support via email.  Here is the reply: ---  --- "Thank you for contacting Hallmark Technical Support. ---  --- We apologize for any difficulties that you may have had with our software. ---  --- This is a newly found issue with the program.  The developers are currently working on an update that will correct this.  They said that the update should be out around Christmas.  Please routinely check for new updates by going to the Help menu and selecting the Check for Updates option.  When an update is available, you will be informed and it should automatically install the update." ---  --- This is a "printing" software so when it does not print properly, it indicates that the software was not tested properly or simply the publisher expect the users to be beta-testers!  If some other features that did not work, it may be excused, but this bug is unexcusable!  ---  --- I am sure the software developers will have the software bugs fixed, but at the meantime don't be a beta-tester,  buy someting else.

I'm sure that if the camera worked properly, it would have been fantastic; however, I received a camera on my birthday this year, only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism.  I took 4 blurry shots of my son's birthday party, and the next time I turned the camera on, the LCD screen was broken.  We purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy, so when I brought the camera (10 days old, mind you) in for repair, they insisted that I'd dropped it and broken it (which I hadn't), even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches, dents or anything.  After sending it in, Best Buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix, and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until I'd paid for the LCD screen to be fixed.  Disgusted, I retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed.  I contacted Sony, who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair.  I ended up receiving a call from their repair center, informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that LCD screens are not covered, whether I received it broken or not.  I tried a third time for repair, only to be told that I would have to pay.  My mother tried to use her Buyer's Protection Plan from her Visa (it was a birthday gift from her to me), only to have her money refunded, then re-charged months later when Best Buy's legal department wouldn't pay her Visa bill. --- Based upon our experiences (among other bad experiences with Best Buy), we stopped shopping at Best Buy, and now own a lovely Olympus camera.  Don't buy the Sony Cybershot DSC-T9	neg
My son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift.  However one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that.

I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working! ---  --- The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene. ---  --- The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years. ---  --- If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie	pos
This is a great little camp kitchen, just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site. I have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it's massive in size and more suited for extended stays, the Guide Gear Camp Kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays. It's compact both set up and in it's carrying bag, it'll take up hardly any space while traveling. Perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table. The hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food, paper supplies, etc. This is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you'd need to enjoy the great outdoors. I highly recommend it...Buy it, try it.... You won't be dissapointed	pos
I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials. ---  --- This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels. ---  --- I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level. ---  --- I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam	neg

First of all I am a huge Beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love. With that out of the way I can say that this was a very good movie.  --- For those expecting a movie like A Hard Days Night, it is nothing like that. This movie is about John Lennon's friend who was the bass player for the Beatles at the begginging  of their carrear. it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a German lady. I wont tell u the ending, but this is a true story. --- All in all i thought this was a great movie. You should defiently buy it	pos
This is part 2 of a set titled SAY IT RIGHT. The CD has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover. Also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track, non-album track, but an added dance remix plus video. If you enjoyed the first 2-track CD then this is a must. Dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production. ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT [Radio Edit] has the catchy dance beats, nice vocals, excellent drums, and chorus. The lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning. Apparently, it's about not giving a lover power to control, destroy, or make you loose sleep. The melody has great rhythm, chorus, dance styles, and energetic beats. "You don't mean nothing at all to me" is repeated showing a strong message that life doesn't end with someone who isn't right.  ---  --- WHAT I WANTED brings Nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion. It's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility. It's about going for something you wanted but never got. The outcome doesn't matter because the reality is you gave it your all. As she sings about her dream and what she wanted it's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so. The melody is soothing, pleasant in sound, and refreshing for the soul.  ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT [Peter Rauhofer Remix Part 1] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet. The song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects, different introduction, pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs, up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers. Straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes, swirls of sounds, and much club ambiance. It's dreamy, fantasy filled, and definitely highly paced for the dance floor. If anything is certain it is this: The Remix in this CD is much better than many of her past singles. There is true DJ styles incorporation more instrumentations, effects, and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans. Quite sticky, infectious, and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non-stop. Club lovers don't pass this out. Nelly's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a effects are vastly hard.  ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT VIDEO [Enhanced CD] is the video many have already seen as Timbaland and Nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced. This is an excellent video with much dance styles, highly energetic beats, and flairs for control and getting the message across. ---  --- Overall, from all of Nelly's singles I find this to be on the top of my favorite. The combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable. Definitely buy this if you are a Nelly fan, club hopper, or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion, different styles displayed, and the themes. It's definitely a top sensation. Before it sells out be sure to buy it. The part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you don't want to listen to the remix. This is highly recommended for sure!	pos
Someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag.  It is not.  It is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time	pos
I sew, and I love this magazine. Till recently I had an annual subscription and I need to refresh my subscription again. ---  --- Here are some helpful tips on why you might like to subscribe EVEN IF YOU DON'T SEW, and how to do so if you are out of the States area. ---  --- For Canadians there is a Burda magazine reseller, and it will cost about 10$ Canadian per issue. Which is MUCH less than a normal pattern now. So it saves you on patterns. ---  --- Burda has ways to subscribe for each country, just go to their website and click till you get the reseller for your own area. ---  --- WHY BURDA IS THE BEST! --- The fashions presented are 2 years ahead. I found that styles presented in Burda were a year ahead of hitting the stores in retail, and 2 to 3 years ahead of the other major pattern companies, and about 1 year ahead of Burda's pattern envelopes sold in the fabric stores. ---  --- EVEN IF ALL YOU DO IS LOOK AT UPCOMING STYLES and never sew a stitch you will find this magazine useful to keep ahead of trend curves.  ---  --- This is what the European ladies are wearing.  ---  --- All clothing is well put together, showing current trends (future trends for north america!) in Europe in shoes, purses, jewelry, colour choices and more. They use fashion forward textiles to make the garments and the photos are clear enough that you can get trim detail and figure out fabric from your local store.  ---  --- Looking at their trends page in each issue will give you an idea where things are going in accessories as well as fashion. ---  --- If you do sew, this magazine will keep you from wasting money on outdated paper patterns and keep you in the front end of fashion. After all if you go to the trouble of sewing, and fitting it's nice if you can wear something for a few extra years and look up to date while doing so. ---  --- Each magazine comes with ALL the patterns in regular sizing to make all the clothing featured. Look thru, see what you like and trace off your own pattern. ---  --- A note about sizes --Burda fits much closer than normal pattern companies which makes for a much nicer fit, but you may find yourself needing to go up a size or two.  ---  --- Measure carefully, and try cutting one size up till you get used to the fit. Don't cut into expensive fabric till you are used to how they fit. Make a few cheaper garments first. The armholes and the crotch area fit differently than north american clothes. ---  --- Plus sizes are not in all the featured clothes, but have a separate plus size section in the magazine. REALLY nice styling for plus sizes too. However be aware that above a size 20/22 in north american sizes, won't fit into these plus sizes. Their idea of plus is 14-20/22. ---  --- They have a special Plus size magazine as well as Burda Moden, which is all plus sizes, and it comes out twice a year. I found that to be a useful addition to my regular Burda magazine and the clothing was never duplicated from one to the other. ---  --- Children's and Men's outfits are featured in many but not all of the issues. ---  --- Here are a couple of helpful hints to dealing with tracing off the patterns in the centerfold.  ---  --- I used waxed paper in the usual kitchen type roll and traced with a sharpie marker pen.  ---  --- WHY WAX PAPER? It's cheap, you can SEE THRU IT, and you can fuse it into bigger sheets as needed. ---  --- FUSING WAX PAPER: take a warm iron, and press thru a paper towel so you don't get wax paper on your iron. (when you finish, run your iron over a clean terry facecloth to absorb any wax that seeped out). When fusing, hold till the wax paper clings and it will look a bit "bubbly". ---  --- EDITED TO ADD: USE A HIGHLIGHTER PEN to mark the lines you are tracing off. It will help you "see" the correct pattern peice and the correct size in the spaghetti trail that is the master pattern in the centerfold. ---  --- TRACING: Burda patterns DON'T come with a seam allowance so I added that after tracing my patterns. Using a sharpie and a straight edge for long runs I traced off my desired size in the patterns which look like multicoloured spaghetti lines all over the newsprint center.  ---  --- About all those lines. Here is where my wax paper tip comes in handy. I've tried tracing paper, even interfacing but the multiple lines on a Burda magazine pattern are too much for those usual tracing papers or interfacing. You will need something much more see thru. Wax paper! cheap, almost transparent, sturdy and won't bleed sharpie marker ink. ---  --- Burda doesn't print one sided pattern masters so you HAVE to trace. You can't just sacrifice the rest of the patterns to cut yourself one only since the other peices will likely be printed on the back. ---  --- REMEMBER TO ADD YOUR SEAM ALLOWANCE ---  --- Once I cut out my pattern (and write all the notes about what size, layout, darts etc on the pattern) I put my pattern pieces in a Manila envelope. ---  --- Pattern envelopes for home made patterns work best with some labelling. I put the magazine (june 05) and the page # (34) and the model I'm copying along with the size, the yardage I require and any sewing notions or extras (zippers, interfacing, 17 buttons, yada yada) ---  --- Maybe due to being a bit obsessive about such things I sketch a line drawing on the envelope with a note saying, skirt, pants, jacket or whatever the garment is. My drawing isn't perfect but I try to include a front and back view with major seams and darts drawn in. It's useful. ---  --- I keep them in a normal household file folder, since the manila envelopes fit perfectly. ---  --- File under Jacket, Dress, Skirt etc. or by year. ---  --- There, I hope that helps. This is WELL worth getting even if you never sew a single stitch from the magazine.	pos
Product arrived as expected.  I've had the tooth brush for about a year now and I love it.  One complain I have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty.  It cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach.  I have not tried soaking it in Oxyclean, that might work even better. 	pos
The case looks exactly as in the pictures above, and the camera fits perfectly in it. However, the case is hardly a protection, it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. The velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so I've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. Fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around, so my camera stays with me in any event. --- There is a little strap on the case, supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps, but it opens too easily, so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case, which is not much). --- There is also a small pocket in the back, providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 AA batteries) and the USB cable. Again, the velcro on it is too easy to open, even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket. --- Definitely, this is not designed as a practical solution. Just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches. --- If you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun, while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents, DON'T buy this one. Spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. I will	neg
Good news Mike Leigh fans, this movie is now scheduled to be released on DVD on September 6, 2005 according to Amazon!!   ---  --- The movie is an excellent one.  Sometimes (unjustly) considered one of Leigh's lesser works it functions both as comedy and drama as it looks at the reunion of two friends from college several years after they have graduated and have been trying to find their niche in the world.  Told in a series of flashbacks and in present time it shows how he characters have grown over time while many of their vulnerabilities remain. ---  --- A must for any and all Mike Leigh fans	pos
I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller.  I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online.  Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places.  The reviews were great & the price was right.  I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it.   ---  --- This stroller is great!  It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide!  I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly.  It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid.  Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!).  It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot. ---  --- I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones.  My 2 year old likes to "nap" (recline the seat) while we are walking.  The back zips off, she likes to look out the back.  A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt.   ---  --- Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller.  However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket.  I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff. ---  --- Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!	pos

this is quite a sharp turn from francine's previous album (40 on a fall day)... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble's work in poundcake, this time around it's quieter, subtler, sweeter and sadder. make no mistake, this is a break-up album. even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold, lonely, hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can. ---  --- the mood will draw you in and keep you listening, but after a few listens it's the songs you'll fall in love with. ahh, the songs. they're densely packed with chord changes, odd but appealing lyrics, and unexpected instrumentation. they're hooky without being obvious (a francine specialty). this was my favourite album of 2003, and i still listen to it pretty often these days. ---  --- best tracks: this sunday's revival, silver plated 606, novelty, 13 years. --- best lyric: "read a year old mail / now you should've told me / i've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly	pos
As a teacher I use Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher when working with students AND engaging in professional activities (presentations to organizations, etc.)  I have been using Office 2002, and thought I should upgrade.  BIG mistake.  The ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through, especially since I previously just customized the toolbar so everything I needed was immediately available.  I'm still trying to figure out how to type in Chinese, although the Spanish and German are working fine.  Additionally, they've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons/icons/etc.  As a previous commenter noted, making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems, and I also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber.  It took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual, and I ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar. ---  --- The designs in Publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate.  In previous versions, you could see the stark differences between different designs.  In the current options pages, everything is so soft, both in line and color, as well as being so small, that it's hard to tell what you're looking at. ---  --- But the truly big disappointment is PowerPoint.  Their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill--I would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in 2007.   ---  --- I have reinstalled my 2002 programs.  I feel like I just wasted all the money I spent on this suite.  My suggestion?  If you absolutely have to have a PC because you do a lot of word processing, stick with Word 2002 or 2003.  If you need to do presentations/brochures/etc. for your business, get a Mac and avoid this problem altogether	neg

These are truly good gluten-free cookies.  We have recently made the switch over to a casein-free (milk free) gluten-free diet for the sake of my son.  He is already a picky eater, so I was worried about the transition.  These cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served (ie in church school etc).  He is particularly enamored with them because they have kid-friendly animal imprints.  Being gluten free, they do tend to break more, which can be upsetting for young kids, but they taste so good, he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces. 	pos
Why pay $46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer (Impact) for only $19.95 at B&H Photo and Video.

Let's face it, it's hard to find a watch that has it all: a nice band, a decent color scheme, an elegant but not overbearing look.  This has it.  I'm sure some will say that the animation is too much, but it's very subtle, and it can be stopped at the tough of a button.   The crystal is not too large, and  not too small, and the band is tough	pos
I have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and I think it is superb!! I now know that the ALIEN movies rock! The tone of the music fits the movie. I especially like " Ripleys Them" Because it reflects on what has  happened with Ripley through-out the movie. The cloning, learing,  remebering and also meeting her clones. I would also like to say that the  movie was  excellent aswell. The cast did a great job, acting their hearts  out.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet should be proud of the music and his film.So if  you aren't an Alien fan, you sure as heck will be after you listen to the  soundtracks!               ~   Jenna  	pos
That so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. Between her utterly uninspired "devotional dances" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the "Sticky One" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to "anoint" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. It's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. The thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. There's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak "evolutionary". If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend	neg
Compared to the energy bars on the market these days (Cliff, powerbar, etc.) that taste terrible, Hooah bars are awesome.  They really work too, energy wise.  Great for long bike rides, triatholons, etc. or even something to eat before practice for athletes.  They are awesome; I am a huge fan	pos

A well-researched look at aviation that reminded me of the novels of Nevil Shute. --- My favorite chapter was Friday Norton QA 11:50am.

The heroine a single mom researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards. But as the jeopardy increases, the guards aren't there.

Perhaps the long shadow of Francis Parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the French and Indian War (Seven Year's War).  Whatever the reason it's good to see from the publication of several books that Americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre-revolutionary period when the British were triumphant and the Indians still counted as a political force.   ---  --- It's past time for a thorough revision of Parkman -- who was ungenerous with the Indians although I thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity -- for example, the "insensate fury" of the Iroquois.  Actually, the Iroquois were less insensate than they were astute.   ---  --- Calloway omits the bloody details and vivid writing of Parkman but he gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the English victory over the French in North America.  In particular he focuses on the frontier and the built-in conflict of American settlers, British policy, and the Indian tribes who either went down to defeat with the French or were betrayed by perfidious Albion.  They made their point, however, in Pontiac's War and by clearing white settlers from the frontier. But their  numbers were declining and they would soon be overwhelmed.  ---          --- This is a good book about the issues of the frontier between Whites and Indians.  In addition, there's a good account of the French movement from Canada to Louisiana and the Spanish rule in Florida and the trans-Mississippi.   ---  --- Smallchief 	pos

I bought three DVDs(The Wood was one of them)and the DVDs were in European codes which means they won't play in the United States unless you own a "special" DVD player.

This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices	neg
This product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home.  While others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes, I found that I could keep it velcro'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom.  My daughter really liked this, but quickly outgrew it.  At just one month old she didn't want her arms tied down, so the usefullness of the product is limited.  For a baby who loves being swaddled, this is an indispensible item.  I'll pass mine on with our hand-me-downs.  You never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled	pos
This mat is great.  My advice for all you yogis that can't keep your hands from reenacting Starsky and Hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative.  You have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new (expensive) mat in the back corner of your closet.  First, I recommend that you buy an organic degreaser.  Give your mat a couple of sprays (not too much), give it a scrub with a brush, hose it off, and hang it out to dry.  This should help.  Option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda.  Don't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes.  I put my mat in the washer and haven't had any problems, but I'm not sure if Manduka would actually endorse that.  With that, and a little bit of wear and tear, you should end up with a solid mat.	pos
This is the original version of this film with David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and other very familiar faces.  The film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good.

The K790a is currently the best "Cybershot" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones. ---  --- In summary, this is a great camera.  Oh, the phone functions are fine, too.  Reception is pretty good on the T-Mobile + Cingular networks (used by Speak Out Wireless).  Voice is clear and loud.  Really good.  5 stars	pos

I first tried Amazing Grace a couple of years ago.  At that time I had a dresser full of department store colognes.  The scent of Amazing Grace is somehow undescribable.

We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you	neg
I'm sure it would work well somewhere, just not for our small business.  I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE.

The fine print on the box tells you this is a "multi-terrain" vehicle, instead of an "all terrain" vehicle, this is because while they advertise it to go through sand, and grass, and mud, what they actually mean is that it will go through dry sand, such as you would find in a desert, dry grass, such as you would find on the african savannah, and dry mud, such as you would find in their fertile imagination.  Mine has shorted out and stopped working just going through dewey grass. 	neg
I don't know a whole lot about coffee, but I do know that I really like the taste of this. Some of the Senseo coffees I have tried have been chemically and harsh (specifically some of the flavored ones) and required a lot of cream and sugar to become palatable. This however, requires just a drop of cream and less than a single pack of sugar. The flavor is a little bit weaker when it first hits your tongue as a result, but it strengthens over the next 5-10 seconds. It never gets overpowering, but it is very pleasant. If you need a quick boost of caffeine, then you can drink it fast without killing your tongue. If you want to sip it, then you might want to make it a little bit stronger than they recommend, but it is still very good	pos

The Station Agent is a touching, yet off the beaten path kind of flick that I found simply endearing to watch. Fin (Peter Dinklage) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in New Jersey. Having a passion for trains, he embraces this as his home. However, he only wishes to be left alone and finds that's not as easy to do as he would have thought. ---  --- First, he discovers Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who has set up a food truck outside his home. Joe is a conversationalist, desperate to talk to anyone and everyone. Next Fin meets Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who almost runs him off the road, twice. These three appear to have nothing in common, and despite all odds, they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see.  ---  --- All three actors gave amazing performances. Dinklage, as always, commands every scene he is in. I've missed seeing him since the bastards at CBS quashed Threshold, so it was nice to see something with him in it again. Cannavale amused me with his character, Joe, who really needed to "get a life." The idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least. And Clarkson radiated as Olivia, a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her.  ---  --- What I liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through Fin's eyes. There were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average. Plus, there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier didn't even see that he was standing there, so she didn't ring him up until he could get her attention. It just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically. ---  --- All in all, excellent film	pos

I bought this DVD because it features Alan Rickman. I also purchased it because of someone else's Amazon review (They sounded like they really knew what they were talking about). I am glad I bought it used, because if it were new, I would feel that I'd been cheated. ---  --- The movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor's office. There was no sense of suspense, and I was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea (Mind you, I'm NOT the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy). ---  --- The dialogue throughout was tedious and trite; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line, as well as the director and the editor. ---  --- The plot was, in some respects, totally illogical, and at other times nonsensical. Even previous scenes don't tie in neatly enough at the end. The plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible. The choices the characters make - whether restless, bored, frustrated - don't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film (Like a greedy, unwashed vampire). ---  --- The movie features a wealthy, bored couple. I was also bored. But I'm not wealthy. ---  --- However! All the actors did their best within the limitations of this film. Polly Walker was very convincing as a sensitive, but hypercritical wife. In fact, I'd say she provided the best performance, and her character was the most three-dimensional and human. They should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character.  ---  --- Norman Reedus was fairly genuine as the young man, although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive. He failed to grab my empathy. Which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded, wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment. ---  --- Alan Rickman did his usual subtle work, but it was so subtle that I thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming. His attempt at an American accent did not fly too well. Later in the movie, however, he becomes much more interesting.  ---  --- The end lacked passion and was not surprising at all; it was entirely predictable. ---  --- For Rickmanistas, yes, you get to see Alan naked. So, just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy. ---  --- I have always admired Alan Rickman - I'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film. ---  --- So, I give it two stars. *Yawn	neg
1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of  Cleveland. Just like their other fellow Ohion's DEVO, the guys in PERE UBU obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.I have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and I have never grown tired of this album. I find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago,  if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it, it  just would'nt happen. There is just a certain magic that they  captured in 1978, as to the music itself I tend to break - up this  album into 2 distinct parts. Side One being the more accessible "drunken" side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise, but a little too intelligent, just listen to the lyrics.Side 2 is definately the "drug" side like a bad acid trip vocalist David Thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of Cleveland(I have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.I could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize, experience and consume at your own leisure, and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album  mean to you. So if you loved things like Throbbing Gristle's song Hamburger Lady then u will surely love Pere Ubu's album the Mordern Dance.As another reviewer mentioned before Black Francis of The Pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.I also hear there influences in recent  bands such as Portishead and Queens of the Stone Age just to name a few.So if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album, even if you have to beg,steal or borrow it.	pos
I admit that my expectations were totally wrong concerning this film. I was expecting a Spanish reworking of Noel Coward's famous play about the dead returning to humorously haunt the living. The advertising for Volver in the local media certainly led me to have this expectation. Maybe this is why I found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing. But even on it's own terms I found Volver a difficult movie to enjoy. Others see a celebration of strong women. I see a movie about murder, incest, deceit and theft. Every main character here is a criminal. Raimunda, her mother, her daughter, all commit one crime or another, some truly monstrous. Who is there to admire? This is empowerment? I'm trying to avoid spoilers here but suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this whole film. ---  --- Aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a director as experienced as Almodovar should have produced a tighter work than this. There are numerous loose plot threads here. The whole subplot concerning the Jerry Springer-like tv show didn't really make any sense. The restaurant owner seems to like Raimunda but nothing comes of this. In fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out, with no resolution. When the movie ended my first thought was "What, that's it? It's over?". People might say "Well, life has loose ends" but this is a movie, not life. It should have an ending.  ---  --- I know I'm definitely in the minority concerning Volver. My wife thinks I'm nuts for not liking this film but I really think the emperor has no clothes here	neg
I ordered three of these for a part based on price and others recomendations.  I was not at all disapointed.  I LOVED them.  Next year I am going to order a bunch at the begining of the year for all my cook-outs.  They shipped fast, and were well packaged.  And the Taste?  Oh the taste...   I can't return to store bought ones... 	pos
When my son was born in May I tried the Dr Brown's bottles based on a co-worker's recommendation, and I am so glad I did!  My kids are all primarily breastfed, but for times when I need a bottle, Dr. Brown's are now the only ones I will use. My son is almost 4 months old now, and has had very little gas, and has never had any problems with colic! I wish I had had these bottles when my other children were babies. ---  --- As for those whining about the extra parts to clean.. Puh-leeze! I hand-wash all my baby's bottles anyway, but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with?? Dr. Brown's makes it as easy on the parents as possible, but who doesn't take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best? With the little brush to use on the straw and vents, it really takes no time at all, so stop the nonsense. Anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up ONE at least, but I know you will go out and get more if you do	pos
I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book.  But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me.

This product totally frizzed out my hair. I had been having good luck for once with Paul Mitchell's foaming mousse. This Jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. A lot. Perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe I just don't have fine, limp enough hair I was very sad	neg
Having only seen Seinfeld's series on TV that goes by the same name, it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on DVD. ---  --- I'd never seen the DVD before, but some of the material sounded familiar... Perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the Seinfeld show? ---  --- You may notice that in his speel about the Chinese he lets the word "shovel" out too soon (when talking about the Chinese's perseverance with chopsticks), and thus spoils the joke a little bit.  But Seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib, so he managed to work around it. ---  --- A thoroughly recommendable DVD	pos
I bought this product at Sephora.  I had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  When I tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  I took it back to Sephora for an exchange since I was still within the 30 day exchange period.  The second one worked for about two months...then the SAME thing happened.  I was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  This product is horrible.  I never dropped it or anything like that.  In fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, I would place it back in the box it came in.  I am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is. 	neg
One reviewer, though she raves about it, admits its flaw:  it cant be put back into its carrying form.  Indeed, it's a floppy, illconceived mess.  It basically works but there is a much better option out there: the BuggyBag.   ---  --- This "floppy" is not an easy one hand install, it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact (not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes) and B)because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car. ---  --- After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop'n'Dine, I've found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution:  Truly a neat one hand install; easy zip back into its carrying shape; 2 belts (one for baby, one for cart) neat and simply storage options.  (Read my AMApedia article)   ---  --- Dont take my word for it, go to a big Baby store and try out both.  Just standing there you'll see that there's no comparison.  I'm... shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy, but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag. --- 	neg
After purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started, it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data. At one point, (after two weeks) I lost all my data. Despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing. ---  --- Since then i am struggling with Creative Technical SUpport team as there  --- is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website (which both is not been of much help) --- This player hasnt been much of use to me yet and I deeply regret having paid 360 USD.  ---  --- I gave it 2 stars because I was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling, this was quite a pleasure	neg
The dispenser looks good, holds a decent volume of shampoo, conditioner etc. It is simple to refill the bottles, and so far there is no leakage. The mounting was easy, glued onto the tiles with silicone glue (included). If it broke or we decided to replace it, we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles. The top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front, so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head, the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf. The little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads. Overall satisfied, good product for the price	pos
I was expecting this book to be a great story, but very disappointed. I cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is. The book is insipid and dull,  has no flow, no story, or no plot. Let me present an example. I have read many insightful Newsweek articles by a writer Allan Sloan. For example, Sloan describes a Sprint merger event in this way, "If talk is getting cheaper, why did MCI WorldCom pay $115 billion to buy Sprint? The once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world. Can regulators handle the complex new order....."  It has a clear logical axis, and has a force to attract readers into it.  ---  --- But Jeter describes it like this,  "The merger announcement of WorldCom and Sprint spurred building activity around Worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity. The real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit....." It always presents off-center, trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact, like "the merger of company A & B raised the stock to $X" etc. There is no insight here.  ---  --- But unfortunately, unlike Enron scandal, there is no other book that centered on the Worldcom scandal. You would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in Newsweek or Business Week, if you have LexisNexis or EBISCOhost.	neg

This is the worst movie that was ever made. I'd rather move to Paris and hang out in cafes debating French politics than watch this movie again. It is so bad that it's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity-- it is disappointing from every angle. In this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film. I can't even force myself to describe the movie, it's not worth the effort. I don't like thinking about the movie as I write this. What I'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie. Are they nuts, or just the products of our modern, mindless universities? Someone needs to tell them it's time for their medicine and to stay off the Internet	neg

This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports. ---  --- After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this. ---  --- I will not buy another Canon Camera.  This camera was made too cheaply.  I wish things were not made to break right away	neg
This dry iron is absolutely amazing, I really can't say enough about it. Great for ALL TYPES of hair! It heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time. Plus your hair comes out extremely straight. Highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours. It is an investment in your hair, one of the better ones I've made.	pos
If you're like me - middle-aged, white, male, conservative, Christian, who buys most of my clothes at Old Navy - you will be the target of all the condescending ridicule in every article.  And yet I find it very entertaining!  Although I'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits, and I'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views, I find their articles interesting, well-written, and insightful.  I must admit, I should hate Esquire, because the editors and writers would find me disgusting.  But somehow I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month.  The writers, if nothing else, are intelligent, which is more than I can say for the writers in most guy magazines like FHM and Maxim	pos
the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over, and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested, defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place.

This magazine took a radical change in direction earlier this year, meaning most reviews prior to April 2006 are essentially reviewing a different magazine. ---  --- I was a subscriber since the early 90's and have recently cancelled.  This magazine had a mid (end of life?) crisis and now wants to cover just about anything that uses electricity.  And cars!  Why would I pick up PC Magazine to read a car review?  Their "improved" layout uses cartoonish hand drawn arrows and "cool" sayings to replace actual review content.  What is their market here?  12 year old geeks with an extra $80k laying around to drop on an SUV?  Get real.  Until this magazine makes another radical change in direction to get back on topic, it is best avoided	neg
I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely. ---  --- You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer.  ---  --- I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product. --- 	pos
I bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down. I loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it, as a friend told me so I gave it to my mom to use. I knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones. I am a very price sensitive, I shop at consignment shops, etc and I still feel the money spent is worth it! ---  --- The reason I like this stroller: ---  --- 1. You can guide it with one hand. --- 2. There is a spot for bags, etc underneath.  --- 3. The cup holder for mommy and child. (this is an extra accessory) --- 4. It's lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily.  --- 5. The five point harnes	pos
Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three  pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid	neg
I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature.  I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it.

In terms of pre-natal resources, this is the best I have found!  The positive results are proven.  I can not think of a reason not to buy this product.

Purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday. ---  --- Reason? My computer was moving much slower than it used to. Mcafee scans my computer everyday, and doesn't find anything, yet it was fully updated. I had a feeling it wasn't working. ---  --- When I installed this thing, I scanned it right away. This is what it found: ---  --- Viruses: 67 ---  --- Spyware: 312 ---  --- Adware: 51 ---  --- After the scan, everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again. I am very pleased with Panda's software and will purchase again if needed	pos
This car charger is amazing for the price. You go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better.

"Animal Farm" is a personal favorite of mine. And I dont understand why this song does't get more recognition - in my opinion, the most underrated song ever written (yes i know, its a bold statement). Theres something about Davies' voice in "Animal Farm" that makes this song unforgettable - particularly in this part: ---  --- 'While I lay my head upon my pillow --- Little girl, come play beneath my window --- Though she's far from home --- She is free from harm --- And she need not fear --- She is by my side --- And the sky is wide --- So let the sun shine bright'  ---  --- The build up to Davies screaming "She is by my side" is really breathtaking. The title track and "Starstruck" are just as excellent. This album is a real treat and should be in everybody's collection	pos
This item had a description for ages three and up.  This isn't even close.  Now I'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five-year-old who is so attached to the fact it's a Batmobile he can get in, even if his knees practically knock at his chin, that I'll never pry it from him.  He's only going to be able to  even get in it for probably two more months.  It was a complete waste of money.  It's suited for two to three-year-olds and small four-year-olds	neg
The bottle itself is a real looker, with thick rich smooth glass encasing golden rich amber jewel like liquid on the inside. Fancy shmancy I said as I took it out of the delivery box.  --- I opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my, it's definitely worth the price tag. --- The real test of course came at bath time, and this sure delivered beyond looks alone. ---  --- The bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm, primrose vanilla and the rich, juicy and creamy finish of the apricot. This should be eaten, not bathed in! --- Insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative, but better yet for yourself. ---  ---  Apparently this can be used as a body wash, and I am really looking forward to using it in the shower, as I'm a shower person in the morning, and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure. I have reviewed a few of these bath items today, and now I feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that I feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath. It's little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day, and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub. Even my boyfriend loved the scent as he used it the other day, so it can be for both men and women, but I might have to hide it in case he secretly likes it too much!	pos
I got this product after seeing the ads on tv for possibly the hundredth time.  I need to clean dirty fingerprints off my cabinets.  I opened the package.  Followed directins exactly and got nothng for my troubles.  I used the first sponge in the package.  It got less than half a cabinet door clean before it started breaking apart in my hand.  I was willing to accept that the first one was possibly defective but not the second one.  It cleaned an area smaller than the size of a quarter before it started coming apart in my hand.  I wasn't even pressing very hard.  I'll stick to my sponges with the scrubbing pads for cleaning my cabinets and other things around my house.  I'm a little ticked that this didn't last for one good cleaning let alone one good minute. 	neg
This 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera, so it's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm. I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear, which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. It is a well-made lens, made with high-grade materials. What this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes, close-quarters interior photography, and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces. Personally, that's what I like, so I'm very happy with this Sigma 10-20mm	pos

I like this knife very much; it's size, shape, fit in the hand, and pocket clip are all just what I wanted. It has a nice edge and the Speed Safe assisted opening feature is fantastic. My only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one-handed opening difficult with the safety engaged. I want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and I don't want the knife springing open in my pocket. This is only a minor quibble, though. I do enjoy the knife very much; it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day-to-day use, which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway. I use a different, larger knife for heavier duty use	pos

Every mother/father should definitely purchase a baby monitor. Until this came I could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not.

Any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement.  Just the way it is.  So if you think you can by pass this point, than forget it.  But if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand.   ---  --- The biggest debate is water or sand?  does it really make a difference?

Unless you want the Editor's liberal political views SHOVED down your throat, avoid this magazine.  It leans to the left so hard that you have to lie on your side to even read it.  (And no, I am NOT a Republican or Democrat, but an Independent who looks at all sides).  The Editor of this magazine has a huge agenda to get the Democrats back in power, he bashes Bush and the Republican party over the head with a 10-ton hammer on a monthly basis, yet worships eco-phonies like Laurie David and celebrities who want the rest of us to drive eco-friendly cars while they fly the world in their private jets. (I understand Laurie and her friends like Sheryl Crow ARE "trying" to wean themselves off this practice by cutting down on their private jet hopping trips a wee bit and using a huge gas guzzling bus that is criss-crossing the country instead, but that poor Laurie is finding this hard to give up.  What hyprocrites these Hollywood folks are!)  Though I am personally trying to do my bit for the environment, I hate when I read issues like the current "Green" issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us "common people" to make the changes. This used to be a great fashion, entertainment and current event magazine with a lot of in-depth articles, but now it is only a political platform publication.  I now will just throw it away as soon as it arrives when I receive it, until my subscription expires	neg
This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!).  It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.   ---  --- The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing.  Save your money! 	neg
I picked one of these up several months back and have been very satisfied with its performance.... The coil is waterproof and can be used in shallow water, wet soil or sand which makes this a great beach detector. It's okay and recommended to drag the coil along the ground back and forth SLOWLY for maximum depth. It runs on only 2 9-volt batteries which by using headphones you can really extend the life of. While it doesn't have any visual target windows like more expensive detectors, the two-tone audio speaker is the key to determining what kind of metal you've found. You can literally turn this thing on and go! There's only 2 dials of operation to worry about "all metal" (a 10 o'clock setting is good) and it can be used in concert with the "discrimination" dial (11 o'clock is good here) to eliminate iron and other junk metals. It's simple enough for a child to use and understand.... To save the prospective buyer some trouble, read the manual carefully and practice around your house and yard before taking this into the field --- trust me. This is an ideal first detector for someone who isn't sure they'll like this hobby and don't want to spend lots of money to find out. Bounty Hunter also offers a 5-year limited warranty which shows you that they really stand behind their product. RESEARCH is the key to making good finds though, so don't expect great results without it! Read and learn all you can about your local area's history to improve your odds of success. Metal detecting has something big in common with real estate --- location, location, location is the key!   	pos

This is a great product to own.  We really enjoy being able to know the current outisde temp anytime we would like, especially here in Nebraska where we have so many extremes, summer and winter.  The inside thermometer is perfectly accurate (compared to our themostat), the outside temperature is accurate within a couple of degrees (compared to internet weather sites), although I think the variances have to do with sun changes, etc. not necessarily a defect in the product.  The trickiest thing about owning this weather station is figuring out where to locate the outside sensor, it has to be out of direct sunlight and moisture, but still within range of the internal display.  It is a great gift and we have really enjoyed owning it	pos
This item is cheap and I don't mean the price.  It will not stay together.  The plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone.

"The Case for Faith" is the weakest volume in a strong series.  ---  --- Strobel's format is fun and engaging. I find his books as "un-put-downable" as any blockbuster page-turner.  ---  --- Strobel holds a degree from Yale Law School, and he was an award-winning legal editor at the Chicago Tribune. He begins with a question: "Does historical evidence support the historicity of Jesus? Does current science support the existence of a creator God? Does it make sense to have faith in God?" and then travels North America, interviewing acknowledged, academic experts on the question at hand.  ---  --- Some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web  protest: "But, Strobel's books aren't fair, because he only presents one side!" Perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books, titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books. The first three words of each title is, "The  Case for..." No, Strobel is NOT presenting the case *against* his topic; he doesn't represent himself as doing so. Our Christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly; why should Strobel waste paper and time doing that, when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing?  ---  --- Strobel's accounts of his interviews of the experts are always reader-friendly, but he never talks down to his reader. If you don't want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing, but want to get to the nub of the issue, Strobel is your man. ---  --- These techniques worked excellently in "The Case for a Creator" and "The Case for Christ," but less well in "The Case for Faith." ---  --- There are three remarkably strong episodes in the book; these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks.  ---  --- In the introduction, Strobel interviews Canadian evangelist turned atheist Charles Templeton. Templeton presents a righteous, enraged case *against* God, and then, tearfully, admits how much he continues to adore Jesus, and, indeed, to miss him. This wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a love-hate relationship with their creator. ---  --- In a few brief pages that serve as coda to Chapter One, which  addresses the question of suffering, Strobel's friend Marc Harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car. This very brief account is testimony to the power of faith, even in the face of profound suffering.  ---  --- In another brief passage, Strobel tells of his friend Ron Bronski, who went from being a vicious criminal to being a Christian minister.  ---  --- These highly personal passages are what I will remember best from this book; they were the most rewarding to read.  ---  --- The formal interviews with the experts didn't do a lot for me, and some were alienating. Norman Geisler's treatment of the slaughter of the Amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns. It may be true that in war, children are killed with their adults -- when the US bombed German and Japanese cities during WW II we killed children as well as adults -- but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than Geisler manages to convey. Too, there is doubt, if not complete disbelief, among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place (see Israel Finkelstein.)  ---  --- The chapter entitled "Church History Is Littered with Oppression and Violence" was especially weak, compared to other treatments of the same material. Strobel's treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from Lyndal Roper's work. Strobel doesn't handle understandings of Nazism as a Christian phenomenon well at all. ---  --- The insistence that Nazism was a Christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact, and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter. Nazism was a Pagan and a Scientific phenomenon. The pagan swastika was to replace the Christian cross. Scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace "weak" Christian ideas about humanity's unity as God's children and the value of all life.  ---  --- This is not made clear enough in Strobel's account.  ---  --- All in all, I have to say I've encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books ... and yet, Strobel is such a good writer, and his technique is so engaging, that you could do worse than to read this book. Read the other two books in the series first, though.	pos

I really thought that office was better proir to the whole XP upgrade, but that I will leave to other discussions.  ---  --- This product is your standard Microsoft office products. I am fairly sure that most have experienced their products.

In Boggle, players compete against one another and a 3-minute hourglass to find word combinations across randomly distibuted letter cubes on a 4x4 grid. ---  --- The game develops pattern recognition skills, and because most possible words are only three or four letters long, astute younger players can play adults without too much of s handicap. ---  --- Tactics learned playing Boggle translate well into success at Scrabble and other word games, while the clock management skills help with chess and test taking. ---  --- Boggle is lightweight and makes a good travel game, though you might want to bring a zipper-lock sandwich bag to avoid losing the letter cubes. As an added plus, the game can be played solitaire with minimal dropoff in entertainment value. ---  --- If you enjoy Boggle, you might want to seek out Big Boggle, which uses a 5-by-5 grid (56% more cubes). Words and time limit are both longer.	pos

Leah Stewart is a talented writer. I read this book after finishing her most recent novel, The Myth of You and Me (which I highly recommend). This story is dark and chilling. Olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in Memphis on a hot summer. When the body of girl is found, the case becomes eerily personal for Olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl's story and life. The characters in this novel are deep and well developed, and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in Memphis is well rendered. I highly recommend this book	pos
When putting together the mobile section of this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic.  --- When I turned it on I was disappointed a second time, this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates. It's so loud you can't hear the music, which is a shame because I'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights. --- The third disappointment - the buttons are VERY hit-and-miss. Sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby one worked eventually once I mashed it in really hard). That I could live with, but it's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating. Control for music off, lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. If you have the music and lights going, then turn on the rotation, the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. Then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them. Please bear in mind I am NOT particularly daft - I managed to figure out my TIVO remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile make no sense to me. I thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural curiosity', but after two nights it really got on my nerves, and if I can't figure it out, I don't see how my one year old is supposed to. I can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there.  --- I'm not dismissing this item all together. The music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding. The Minute Waltz is particularly nice (I've noticed my son scans for it). The lights are lovely too, and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the buzzing. My son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep. BUT, if you buy it, I'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it.	neg

I ordered this guitar for my grandson for Christmas.  There is no way to keep the strings tight even though you turn the screws to tighten.  When you do tighten, the strings are brittle (as if really old) and break.

So I will probably be out about $10.00!	neg

Also, for the beginning student, many of the singers' dialogs are also not too hard for them to follow	pos

I recently decided to give these Diedrich K-Cups a whirl.  For years, I've been a dedicated Green Mountain Coffee Roaster customer, and their K-Cup varieties are excellent; however, even at their "Cafe Express" discount rate, their coffees are more expensive by several dollars per 25 count pack than the current price Amazon is offering on Diedrich blends. ---  --- I'd been traveling in Southern California a few months ago and tried some Diedrich coffees then.  Although the coffees I tried tended to exhibit the Starbucks/West Coast tendency to roast beans too darkly -- to the point of effacing some of the original regional characteristics of the beans -- they are fine for dark roasts and preferable to what I've had from Starbucks.  Coupled with the Keurig brewer, this makes for a decent cup of medium-to-dark "West Coast" style coffee	pos

They are good for the price. They have a very good sound quality, or at least better than the ones that came with my Sony Walkman DEJ001. The only problem I had is when I connected them to my older Philips player, it had a low volume output. And then again, even on the Sony player, I had to have the volume at 7, and it only goes to 9. If you have a high output player or a computer, these will be great, but if your using them for a low output or old device, these probably won't cut the cheese	pos
Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot	pos
I ordered this product on June 7th 2006, today is July 11th 2006, and I still have not received it.

This one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on, that turns out to make life so much easier.  It has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work, and go through security to get into work, all without having to open my bag.  The remote has a velcro strap that I use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack.  I am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out.  My only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap.  As the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected, because when things do come undone, you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click.	pos
A total Piece of Garbage, do not buy this at all. ---  --- First of all it is battery operated which i did not know when i bought it.  Secondly, when i went to put batteries in it, the terminals in side of it are offset, one is higher than the other, and the higher terminal was damaged.  When i put the batteries in and put the cover on it did not work, the case was pushing the battery away from the terminal.  It worked without the cover on but that doesnt do anyone any good if u cant prevent the batteries from falling out.  The thing is rather loud too and cover is a piece of cheap plastic.   The thing is a Piece of Garbae, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!! 	neg
I bought this as a surprise for my wife.  When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that "you get what you pay for," but this was a piece of garbage. ---  --- This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever.  The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all.  This will fit like a potato sack, folks.  I notice that the "raw edges" are now listed as a "feature."

They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback, and I would absolutely recant them. ---  --- In their defense: my money has now been refunded. ---  --- Now... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it, worn for 90 seconds?  It would have been off sooner, but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head. ---  --- Wish I could rate as a "zero	neg

Not as epically gorgeous as 'Once Upon a Time in America', but still lovely.  There's a South American influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack.  My favourite track is an Ave Maria--in Guarani.  Haunting.  However, "Gabriel's Oboe" is the theme that makes this score.  Being an oboist, it of course holds a particular appeal to me--and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to	pos
I used to think he was great, till I caught the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.'  All of a sudden you're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in the original, and the spell is broken.  Let's not even talk about 'Air Force One.'  Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad.  And I'm sorry New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great rapers of the high seas?  What will they NOT do for a buck, you might ask.  Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no tomorrow.  Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu.  Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to eleven.  Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history.  I even like some of the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be.  This just doesn't stand up to repeat viewings.  Unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker.  Do you	neg
This product is great. Its much easier to get in Canada that's why I ordered it online since I am now living in the US.  However after the fact - I did find it available at Cost Plus World Market.

Let's make this clear... I won't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself. So this is going to be short and sweet!  This book is a glorified magazine.  Worth $14.95 - tops.  The pitfalls of bookbuying online, I guess.  You never know what you are going to get.  Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared.  The text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared.  The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films.  Throughout the book the author treats these two as the "Coke and Pepsi" of infrared films.  I'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same	neg

My 16 month old loves her new groceries.  The produce &amp; sandwich parts are plastic &amp; each piece has a wonderful texture. The canned goods are very interesting to read.

She has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate.  This was a great purchase. 	pos
My Motorola C139 with Net10 crashed on me.  I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone, except they sent me this flip phone (V171).  I liked my candy bar phone and didn't want this flip piece of junk.  I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing, and then things quickly went downhill.  Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone, even though I had minutes available on the old phone.   ---  --- I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone, which works awesome with no problems.  She had problems all the time with the V171.  She had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed, even the local numbers.  She also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send.  In my opinion, the V171 is completely worthless. ---  --- Overall, I am a very dissatisfied customer.  My recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service.  Go shop Cingular for all the great deals they have	neg

Okami is a fantastic game, perhaps the last great game released on the PS2.  Stylish, fun, and packed with a good bit of humor, this game kept me occupied for over a week.  Although it can certainly be played a good bit faster, most people will probably rack up 30+ hours playing this game through the first time.  The action-adventure style gameplay owes quite a bit to the Zelda series, but the celestial brush adds a nice (and original) gameplay element. ---  --- Okami is not overly difficult, I found it a bit on the easy side.  The camera can also be a bit troublesome in a few places as well, but I would be hard pressed to find many other faults with this game.  Unless you have a real dislike for cel-shaded graphics, I would heartily recommend this game for any PS2 owner	pos
The gym is very easy to assemble, took me about 45 minutes on my own.  The book supplies several different workouts, hitting every major muscle group, and you get good resistance in every workout. You won't get great range of motion on all the workouts, there may be times when you'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch, but those are minor adjustments you'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment.  The gym itself is light, easy to move around the house, and doesn't take up much space. It may be too light, and not sturdy enough in some instances, and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts.  --- The price is outstanding, at 180 dollars. You're not going to find a better deal than this, and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive Bowflex	pos
In general, Lexar's USB drive does its job just as well as other USB drives; there isn't much of a difference except for the following: ---  --- 1) portability  --- good: it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain --- bad: this rubber holder only lasts for so long (in my case 6-8 months) ---  --- 2) it is extremely durable. This drive survived a full 30 minute (clothes) washer cycle. When I took it out of the washer, I thought all the data and the drive was gone for good. To my surprise (after letting it dry for a day) it worked just fine. This is amazing! ---  --- I have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes (not using all of my weight though) a few times on carpet and concrete; and still works fine. ---  --- Finally, I have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it's still fine. ---  --- 3) looks: --- good: it is very easy to see since it is bright red --- bad: it is fatter than other USB drives and it is bright red. The drive is pretty ugly. ---  --- It maybe good to note however, that the drive's structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse. The bright red color's advantage has already been mentioned above	pos
This bracelet looks better than the picture.  It looks beautiful on my wrist. The fifty bucks that I paid for it was a real bargain. I love it. There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now	pos

I'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents.  The candy apple is definitely the most accurate and I'd sell my soul if I could only continue buying it on its own.  But the other 2 are good, too.

Working out used to be heh for me, but after getting the door gym I made a rule. Anytime I enter my bathroom (which is where it is suspended) either before or after I have to do 10 Pull-ups and 10 Neutral pull-ups, also since I purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well. It's working wonders, within the first week of doing pull-ups where i'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up I'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups. I'm very happy with this product, only downside (which I personally don't really care about) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side, the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls. So anyway... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work :P easy workout	pos
First of all, I would have to say is I am deeply moved my this movie. Let me tell all of your Lonesome Dove fans something, DON'T LISTEN TO THERE INSULTS ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, first of all, we don't have TLJ nor Angelica Houston. Those two characters were the major characters in LD next to Gus. But, there is Jon Voight to play Call. Voight may not be the one born for Call like TLJ, but he still does an excelent job and no one except TLJ could have played it better. Barbara Hershey plays Clara. I think she captured the essence of Clara and she did a good job. Rick Shroeder is back and he does a truly unforgetable job as Newt. July Johnson is back along with Pea Eeye. There are some new characters like former texas ranger Gideon Walker, Gus's daughter Agostina Vega, the villian Cheeroke Jack, and a man named Isom who resembles the role of "deets". Although people say that this plot is the same, they are right, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. Just because Mcmurty doesn't write doesn't mean it sucks. It captured the essence that the origianl caught. It had the same beautiful background music. There was a lot of action and adventure and the best part was, the story continued right after Call buried Gus. If you want to have an accurate depiction on what happens to the characters in the original, RTLD definitly shows it. Streets of Laredo is nothing compared to this. This is the true sequel because it delivers the same joy to your heart just like the original. I reccomend this movie to anyone who loves LD and wants to know the continuation of the story. This movie is truly a western. THE EPIC AS BIG AS THE WEST CONTINUES!!!!!!!!!!!	pos

I bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint.  He absolutely loved this set.  The colors are wonderful and the different types of pens, paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him.  The case is sturdy and great so he doesn't lose anything.  The price can't be better for everything you get.	pos
INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.   ---  --- The quality of the transfer is very good (imo).  For example, I was playing back So. Central Rain (early REM) in ITunes and noticed that I had purchased the song on ITunes about a year ago.  Except for an opening click on the LP version, its very hard to tell the difference between the two. ---  --- My only minor negative (or really, feature request) would be for LPRipper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that I don't have to type them all in. --- 	pos
unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated, this product stands in nearly every aspect. The sleek, supreme design by F.A. Porsche makes this product appearance timeless, and its preformance is outstanding, more effective in this model than its smaller, slower (80Gb, 120 Gb) counterparts. The autostart is a little slow for me (its the USB model, not firewire, remeber), but is a totally acceptable feature for the price, design & performance cost-benefit equilibrium. Excellent purchase	pos

this is a very well done record by 3 of Raps most elite personalities.  Cube, Dub, & Mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record.  The beats are amazing on all the tracks.  This is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button.  For me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them.  If you're a fan of the whole West Coast gangsta rap thing, You GOTTA HAVE THIS!  My Fav tracks are "All the Critics in New York", "Do you like Criminals", "Gangsta's make the World go Round", "Westward Ho!", & "Hoo Bangin'"...although like i said, all the tracks are badass.  peac	pos
What an amazing product for such a small price.  It works right out of the box, but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers.  The option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday PC work as well using the pen for graphics.  I use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures.  It really makes a difference. --- The unit seems well made and I like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice.  I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better, but at cost. --- The software bundle is ok too if you don't already have photoshop tools. --- The one quibble is that at home when I installed the drivers it continued to crash my PC with my wireless keyboard installed.  Not ideal, but as I dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me, but be careful, I am sure there will be a fix somewher	pos

I have read other reviews here that this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds. Maybe so but, it is wonderful for 4-5 year olds! Those "in between stages" kids who want to have a small table of their own but, need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers. My son (almost 5) and his big sister (7) can both sit together and eat a snack at this table. It is very sturdy! The small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time. The surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures. The unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space. My son had outgrown 2 "child size" table and chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this table is actually for "Kids" and it has been a big hit at our home. Guess who's getting the matching Lifestyle kitchen for Christmas	pos

A totally awesome movie when it was first released, Hawaii is based on the James A. Michener bestseller. Even at three hours plus, it still had to leave a lot of Michener's novel untouched, but the basic idea is still there. The breathtaking cinematography adds to it, as does an outstanding Elmer Bernstein score. Then there's the acting by the stars, Max Von Sydow as the missionary who goes to Hawaii to preach to the natives, and brings his own brand of religion with him. Julie Anderws is outstanding in a rare non-singing role as his wife. Richard Harris is excellent as the sea captain who is amazed that the preacher's wife turns out to be an old girlfriend. --- The supporting characters are just as memoriable, with an actual islander playing the queen, and also an unknown playing Keoki. --- All in all, take Hawaii complete, or don't take it at all. Wait until the complete version comes out on DVD. I rated it one star because of the cuts, but it is a five-star movie in its complete version	neg
What makes it special is that it's the first PlayStation game ever where you have to defeat your ennemy with a time travel device. --- I gave it 4 stars because the game is too short for an expensive PS2 game ( 2 or 3 hours !).

I respect the message of "The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce" but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce "unexpected."  Those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result.  Staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times.  The author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit. --- I know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time.  They fell apart due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility.  --- What I feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents.  When you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house. --- When you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will be damage, no getting away from it.  However, is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly with the other parent's approval?  I hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion. --- It is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married.  This is  a major flaw in  the research.  I didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. I don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears.  When you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward, kids will suffer. --- I don't like 'studies' like this, they're misleading and potentially damaging.	neg

This is the first Cathe strength workout I've tried, and I found it to be intense and challenging without being gruelling.  However, keep in mind that this is an advanced workout, so intermediates like myself will probably need to lift less weight than Cathe (I generally used 1/2 to 2/3 of what Cathe was using) in order to complete the workout.  Cathe uses a variety of equipment in this workout, including a barbell, several sets of dumbbells, a full club step, and a toning band, but I was able to get by without the barbell, step, or band (although my modifications may have further lowered the intensity of the workout). ---  --- The main workout on Muscle Max is 68 minutes long, but the DVD also offers several premixes:  Upper Body Only (42 minutes), Upper Body Push-Pull (33 minutes), Lower Body Only (23 minutes), and Timesaver (56 minutes).   The full workout breaks down as follows:  Warm-Up, Lower Body, Chest, Back, Lower Body, Shoulders, Bicep, Tricpes, Core and Stretch (the DVD includes subchapters under each of the above categories; see Cathe's web site for a full list of exercises plus video clip).  During the warm-up, you are constantly moving rather than performing static stretches, but I liked that Cathe still managed to thoroughly stretch each muscle group that was going to be worked.  Also, Cathe constantly varies the count, which adds interest as well as varying intensity to each movement.  Another thing I liked about this workout was that Cathe allows plenty of time between exercises, thereby providing you with an opportunity to rest AND to change your weights as needed.  I also enjoyed the upbeat music, some of it vocal. ---  --- Overall, this routine left me feeling completely worked out, yet not exhausted, which means that it was enjoyable and has little dread factor.  I think that both advanced exercisers and intermediates who are will to modify can get a great workout from this video--highly recommended	pos
I seriously did not laugh once in this movie.  Horatio Sanz got me to crack a smile a couple times, but I can't believe I think he should have been in the movie more.  I thought Saturday Night Live was bad, I had no idea!  SNL is gold compared to this.  Every single joke falls flat and the director obviously has no clue how to make a movie.  I can't even tell if Jerry O'Connel and Jake Busey are bad actors because the director doesn't even give them a chance.  I think one thing that could have really helped this movie out would have been a script.  In case the director reads this review I want to tell him you need to have a script BEFORE shooting a film.  Just a tip.   ---  --- One of the worst movies I have ever seen, easily.     ---  --- 0/	neg

Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it	neg

This review is not about the toy, but about the service you can expect to receive from Amazon.com.  If you are buying this as a gift, only do so if you have months to wait, even if the item is listed as available.  Amazon.com will allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your items, and then days later, inform you of a delay in shipping, and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery.

The Grand Theft Auto series and the PlayStation 2 have gone hand in hand, which each game debuting on the PS2 before it travels to other consoles. That all changed with the release of last year's side story, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. This game, designed to take advantage of the PSP's hardware, was an impressive technical feat, managing to pack in a lot of what made the "big" GTA games so memorable. But it fell short in a few key spots, most notably the story, the characters, and the series' biting sense of style and satire. That stuff was easy to overlook when you could carry Liberty City around in your back pocket. But on the PS2, where you can compare it directly to the three Grand Theft Auto games that have appeared there, the whole package is significantly less interesting, even considering the PS2 port's budget price.  ---   --- Not much has changed, so if you've already played this on the PSP, there's not much reason to take on the PS2 version. The game's got a slightly longer draw distance on the PlayStation 2, and the streets look like they might have a few more people on them. But neither of these things dramatically changes the game, and they can't save the game's otherwise murky visuals and often poor frame rate. But it also controls a little better; with the right analog stick back in effect, you've got all the camera control and other buttons you're used to hitting on the PS2. It's neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy, but if you didn't play it on the PSP, Liberty City Stories' $20 price tag is just right. Just don't go in expecting anything approaching the grandiose nature of GTAIII, let alone the bigger, crazier Vice City or San Andreas. And if you've already played it on the PSP, well, there's little reason to play it again, because this is the same game, with the multiplayer modes stripped out.  ---  --- As a return to Liberty City, the New York-themed locale first made famous back in Grand Theft Auto III, Liberty City Stories is all about retreading through well-worn territory. If you still remember the streets of Liberty City, you'll see plenty of the same spots here. But as a game that was designed for the less powerful PSP, you'll probably notice that Liberty City Stories is much smaller in scope than what we've seen in the series more recently. Missions, which grew to epic proportions in San Andreas, are much shorter and feel pretty meaningless in LCS. There are plenty of moments where you'll complete a mission and immediately think, "Well, at least I'll never have to do that again." The story, however, is the biggest casualty.  ---  --- Liberty City Stories tells the tale of one Toni Cipriani, a regular-type mob guy who did a good deed for the head of the Leone crime family, Salvatore Leone. Toni had to go away for awhile, but the heat's died down, and he's back on the job in Liberty City, maintaining his loyalty to Sal while wiping out the family's enemies in droves along the way. As you ascend to become Salvatore's right-hand man, you'll start and finish gang wars with other mafia types, a few triads, the yakuza...pretty much all of the usual suspects are present.  ---  --- If you're familiar with the various mafia presences over the course of the past three GTA games, you'll recognize a few of the names and faces here. But the story stands alone and doesn't require you to remember the various cast members. That's a good thing, because the mafia characters in the other GTA games have been largely forgettable. The game's storyline really isn't up to par with the console installments in the series, because very little actually happens. Even potential plot points are squandered, like when Toni finally becomes a made man but a bad cutscene doesn't actually show the ceremony. The game's mission path doesn't deviate into crazy territory, and most of the characters are fairly lifeless. There are no enigmatic weirdos like Truth, the crazy hippie from San Andreas, or Steve Scott, the porno director from Vice City, to break up the heavier-handed mafia tasks. This dulls the game's personality, preventing its characters and events from becoming as memorable as we've come to expect from GTA games and their excellent storylines.	pos
While previous guides for the serial drama "Lost" have often left something to be desired, the book "Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide" more than makes up for it.  ---  --- Nikki Stafford's attention to detail (and believe me, *all* "Lost" fans should have a great attention to detail) is thus far unparalleled in any other guide book.  ---  --- You name it, this guide book has it. In addition to the usual episode synopsis, Stafford provides readers with all the information they can handle, including keeping track of the appearances of the "numbers", discussing theories, pointing out bloopers and continuity errors, illuminating connections, and just generally proving that she has watched way more "Lost" than any of us. In addition to all that, Stafford gives the low-down on each of the "Lost" cast members, before they became Losties.  ---  --- Even if you have watched each episode of "Lost" 4 or 5 times, and think you have caught every little nuance and clue hidden within it, I guarentee you'll read this book and discover things you didn't catch, or never thought of. One of my favorite features in this book is the essay that details and explains everything on the "invisible" map that Locke briefly gets a glimpse of in season 2 during the episode "Lock Down" when the blast door comes down on top of his legs, and a black light switches on, illuminating the secret map.  ---  --- Bottom line, this book is a must have for serious "Lost" fans. It would also be a great aid to anybody who is just now beginning to get into "Lost".	pos
people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready.

Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of behavior that (in a kid 2 years older) would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self-mutilation or bulemia, as in the movie "Thirteen.	neg

I recently purchased a Bean round zafu and I find it didnt live up to the claims in the least. ---  --- This zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised (wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with). First thing I thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was; this thing seems nothing like the pictures. It's saggy and about half the height of all the images I've seen of it. Not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift (I weigh about 160 pounds so I dont think that weight is the problem). I'm very dissapointed in this product. ---  --- The reason I bought this was not only for the reasonable price but I thought Bean seemed like a quality company. I payed $40 for this wich does seem reasonable. It does "SEEM" reasonable. That is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at. ---  --- I bought this Product from The Comfort Store. Their probably the only internet company; along with Bean of course, I will never buy from again. Unless I learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls	neg

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the Canon A 710 IS.  This camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old HP 935 -- the old guy still worked fine, but was very slow and didn't handle low-light situations very well at all.  I was also looking for a bigger zoom range.  After weighing the options, I decided that the A 710 IS was the way to go.   ---  --- Pros: --- - Uses standard AA batteries.  Invaluable when you're on the go and need more juice.  Also, the battery life has been very good - I'm using the same AA rechargables I used for over a year in my old camera, and I routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge.  ---  --- - Huge LCD screen that doesn't suck power.  Fast response, too. ---  --- - Digital zoom that actually helps!  Because the camera is 7.1 MP and has an image stabilizer, I can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom.  Very impressed. ---  --- - Very wide range of available settings.  You can customize almost any aspect of this camera, from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to.... ---  --- - Big enough, and small enough.  It will fit in my back pocket most of the time, but it's big enough to remind me that it's there before I sit down.   ---  --- - Fast processing time.  Taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old HP took forever!  The fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly, and also jump to an image very quickly too.  Much better than previous Canon models even. ---  --- - Memory backup battery.  Remembers what day it is, time it is, and what image you're on -- even if you take the regular AA's out.  Very useful. ---  --- - Fast start-up time.  It's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on, especially if you bypass the "welcome" image sound and screen. ---  --- - Cool features, like color swap and color select.  Also, there's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera.  The camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video, a nice touch. ---  --- - You can change lenses and add filters very easily. ---  ---  --- Cons: --- - As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I upgraded from the HP was to have better luck with low-light situations.  I've had the camera now for just over a month, and I still haven't figured out the best setting for clear, low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older Canon models, say, the A 510.  As mentioned, there is a wide range of settings available, which can also be a negative if you don't know quite what you're looking for. ---  --- - No "action" setting.  Similar to above, the one setting I miss the most from other Canons is that action setting.  This camera requires you to set it manually. ---  --- - Video file sizes.  A typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 MB -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online.  Also takes up a good chunk of a 1MB memory card, really quickly.  Canon would have done better to use MPEG-4 here instead of AVI.   ---  --- - Similarly, the video quality doesn't reflect the large file size in most cases, though the sound quality is very good. ---  --- - The big LCD is great, but is very hard to see outside in the sun.  It does have a backup optical viewfinder, but using that puts your nose up against that LCD and leaves a nice smudge on it if you're not careful. ---  --- - Buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use, but that's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time.   ---  --- - Bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- I have to go back through the old HP software if I want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600!   ---  ---  ---  --- Overall, as mentioned, the camera is a huge improvement from my old HP, and even with all of those little annoyances, I'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog.  It's no SLR, but it's getting there.  And, you certainly can't beat the price	pos
I really tried to like the Via Michelin, bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007.  But I feel compelled to tell most of you to "keep shopping."  I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to Garmin). I thought "how bad can it be?"  I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it.  This is because my other GPS units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget GPS, optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip.  But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below.   ---  --- First, please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit....but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with "Other" GPS units? Or they didn't spend much time with it before they reviewed it?  Or they haven't had experience with GPS in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing?  ---  --- For positive reviewers, if this is their first "newer" GPS and if they are comparing it to a Car navigational GPS Of 4 years ago, then yes, it is quite a bit better. But compared to the new units like Mio 310x or the Tom Tom One (both of which I own) then the ViaMichelin has a "horrible" user interface, and is horrible to use on the roads. Tomtom and Mio, often finish what you are typing for you, they are intuitive and programmers have polished them. But the ViaMichelin is very non intuitive, absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly.  Sure, we are not supposed to use them while we drive, and with this one it is TRULY dangerous even when you learn the complicated system.  So most of the time, you have to pull over and work on it.  But it is no fun, and even you program it, if you go to another screen it "loses" it and you have to program the history all over.  You will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything, and how "lost" it often gets. I will try to give you the pros: ---  --- Pros:  Small form factor, decent screen, SIRF 3 chip. NAVteq maps. Four hour battery life.  Good price for a Sirf-3 chip unit. ---  --- Cons:  Horrible non intuitive software program, clunky, multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency...or even if you are not in a hurry.  Horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor, you CAN'T hear it with any road noise present...seriously...turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible.  I read this in a review, but honestly didn't believe it until I owned it.  Third, unlike ANY GPS I've had, this one literally tells you to "start driving" before it can tell you which way to go, when you've routed it to the nearest store, etc.  Think about that!  It means sometimes you have a 50% chance of making the right choice as to which way to go...then if you guess wrong, it tells you to turn around and go the other way!  Seriously...that one feature should be enough to make you say "NO" as most GPS will at least tell you to "turn right" from where you are parked or "turn left" but this one will say "start driving" without ANY direction....because it can't seem to route until you drive onto a road.  It can't do it from a parking lot!  It already will have the satellite location...that's not it..it's a software bugaboo I think built into the programming.  It makes you "start driving" because it can't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling.  Bad software design for sure.  When you go to Canada, you have to have installed (on another SD card) the Canadian map....very inconvenient when you cross the border.  Navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal Maine. Literally, we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist.  I found it VERY slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn (MUCH slower than my  Mio 310 which was purchasd last year, or TOM TOM ONe which was purchased this year) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic, caused us to miss several critical exits.  Want to find POI's on the run?  Forget it. Too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands. It often could not find even local Walmarts...one's that have been there for 20 years.  I'm serious.  I parked in front of Walmarts that it could not find...very old Walmarts.  To be sure, Garmin, TomTom and Mio do not list ALL Walmarts, but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town.  Not so Via.  In several towns in Maine and Connecticut, I parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years.  Punch in  local stores on the difficult to use POI list, and it can't find any of them.  Also, punch in or look for stores like nearest Walmart....Mio and Tom Tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location.  But with Via, it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing.  So....you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location, to try to find the store.  Very, very clunky....can't tell you how much trouble that is.  It's so simple on the other units, you get spoiled with the Garmin or TomToms.  This one makes it so hard and still can't find the POI's.  No GPS finds all stores....there is a limit on POI's, of course.  But it seems the Via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for BANK ATM's and not restaurants, shopping, etc. Believe me, once you've used it on a trip, it's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a GPS themselves before. ---  --- I can't say enough about how "difficult" the interface is....and when you go "back" or "forward" to another screen, it often loses where it is...and you have to start all over again programming where you are going, going through multiple difficult steps.  When you lose power, again, you start all over. When I bought it, I read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought....how bad can it be?  I thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason.  WRONG!  The experienced GPS users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek Garmin or Tom Tom interfaces.  Example: On one trip, my daughter began to throw up, and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility....this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one. When you are panicked, you want to quickly find the nearest hospital.  This unit makes you put in the town, etc. if you are further than x miles or so...like when you are on the interstate....so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital.  Which is horrible.  I had this happen before and with the Mio, about 3 clicks and BAM you have searched and found the nearest hospital...one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital.   ---  --- Truly, I am sad to not recommend the ViaMichelin.  I really recommend you "pass" like some other reviewers have suggested. And I recommend you to buy the more rapid, easy to use Mio with the great screen, blazing fast Sirf 3 and calculating chip, and loud-clear-speaker.  If you are tech challenged, buy the Garmin or TomTom's with their awesome and easy to use software interface.   ---  --- But don't buy this bad speakered, horrible interfaced, poorly designed, buggy unit.  On paper, it looks like a killer unit. But in reality, it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use.   ---  --- Finally, there is the "fun" factor.  The TomTom One is fun.  The Mio is fast and fun, a pleasure to use!  Even the newer Garmin's are fun with their simplicity (I hated the screen on some of the old Garmins.)  But the ViaMichelin X-930 has no fun programmed in....it is not a pleasure to use, although it will take you across country.  Believe me, the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker, unpolished, unfun, clunky, interface with poorly organized features and disorganized POI's and menus. The polished quick intuitive menu is where Garmin and TomTom shine.  The only thing better on the ViaMichellin is the screen and Sirf-chip...some of the older Garmin's use an older satellite GPS chip than the ViaMichellin, but new tomtom's and Via use the same GPS satellite chip, but faster software routines and cpu chips.  But even the use of the Sirf-3 chip on the Via Michelin, cannot make up for the poor software and menu design. Theoretically, this thing should be blazing fast, but it is much slower than my TomTom or Mio.  The only thing better on this unit than the Mio, is that the Via is smaller and thinner. And maybe the Navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals.  But other than that, the Mio wins hands down, by far a faster, better and easier to use GPS in my opinion.  If you are looking for software ease, go Garmin first, then Tom-Tom, then Mio, and Via last.  If you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the Mio 310x, it's a killer unit and it's hackable.  But if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going, go with Garmin first, then Tom-tom. I tried you Mr. ViaMichelin, but you need to go to "finishing school" like the other GPS students.  You are just too unfinished and rough	neg

Vet producer Don Was is aboard for this one and he pushes the Ladies to write some of their most mature material, relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather than a sole ingredient. The result is that even the radio tailored material is better than on "Stunt". ---  --- Best tracks here are: lovers sparring in "Too Little Too Late", twangy "Go Home" (possibly the only time you'll hear a country tune with glockenspiel. Parental warning: this is one you'll want to skip if young ears are in the car because of a gratuitous F-bomb at the coda..), the tale of a co-worker dalliance in "Conventioneers" that ends with them feeling awkward about it ("So I wait, come in late, It'd be great if you transferred out of state"), the cheater finally caught in "Humour of the Situation" ("Have you heard the one about the boy who moved into the henhouse to sleep? He woke up with egg on his face, When he found that all the hens had crossed the street") and the ethereal "Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel", which utilizes an almost Disneyish melody in its tale of a man in a traffic accident who, disembodied, surveys his own demise ("In all the confusion, there's something serene, I'm just a posthumous part of the scene"). ---  --- The least interesting tracks are "Off the Hook", another cheater gets him comeuppance tune and "Baby Seat", a gentle nudge to accept responsibility instead of wanting others to look after you.   ---  --- Bottom Line: While not as consistently fabulous as "Gordon", this one hits on all cylinders more than it misses and it utilizes more of the band's talents by allowing more lead vocals from Ed Robertson ("Pinch Me","Falling for the First Time"), as well as Kevin's first on the hidden track "Hidden Sun".  ---  --- You also hear the Ladies do things they haven't before: Steven's flute on "Tonight's the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel", Tyler's 808 drums for "Off the Hook", and a dash of retro courtesy of Ed's wah-wah pedal on "Conventioneers" and Kevin's vocoder on "Humour of the Situation"	pos
My Daughter is 38" and about 30lbs.  It's the perfect size for her.  We mainly use it as something to lay on while watching TV or reading books on the floor.  ---  --- PROS --- - When in the "chair position", it's tall enough to accommodate taller children. --- - Cover is removeable and washable --- - Comes with handy pink storage bag (although it's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed) --- - Pretty easy to convert into chair (there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be "connected" in order to change it into chair - they are color coded).  Might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it. --- - Inside of sleep bag is made of soft material (although it appears as though it may snag easily). --- - Large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag.  Easy for small hands to use. --- - Weight limit: 100 lbs ---  ---  --- CONS --- - The Pump is VERY cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed (it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands). --- - The air slowly leaks out of the bed.  We actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased, so we exchanged for another one.  But this one too deflates pretty quickly.  Example: if we completely inflate at 7pm, by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40% of it's air. --- - Adult help is needed to change into chair. --- - Adult help is needed to inflate. ---  --- OVERALL: It's a bit pricey for the quality I was expecting.  It would be nice if adult assistance wasn't needed to change from bed to chair and back.  Defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night, but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so	neg

My wife bought these for me and I was just putting them on my morning Cheerios like a madman and I said, "Hey, these are good...where did you get 'em?"  ---  --- "Oh, from Amazon...can you believe they were only $17.00?" ---  --- Silence. ---  --- I just looked at her, "Are you nuckin' futs? Gimme those things. I'm going to put them into our safety deposit box with our bonds, our living trusts, and my favorite Hot Wheels..." ---  --- Blueberries are good for you and I would suggest to eat them on a regular basis, but the price for these things is simply absurd. Do I look like I'm wearing my shirt that says, "STUPID"? I don't think so. I'm sure you can get frozen blueberries for less and hey, fresh is always good, and if you can't get frozen or fresh, get a Hostess Blueberry Pie. Sure it's sugary and will feel like you've got a leadweight in your stomach after eating it but the pie is only .50 cents..these little blue suckers are $17.00. That's more than my whole wedding cost. ---  --- Just kidding. I'm not that cheap. Actually, I'm not cheap at all, but I do like money and I refuse to pay $17 for some humiliated looking berries... ---  ---  --- Geesh	neg
This is the best concealer I have ever worn.  It covers well without making me look fake or cakey around the eyes.  Not greasy either.  The powder that comes with this is a nice touch for traveling.

I've never had any problems with Memorex DVD's or CD's. When I was ordering and read some of the reviews here, I had to go back and look at what I was using to make sure.

This map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike, it no longer supports Windows 98, which happens to be the newest OP that my old lap top can use.

Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way. ---  --- There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted. ---  --- The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's. ---  --- The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is. ---  --- In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex	neg
I do not like store-bought cookies, especially Oreos (too dry and greasy for me). But upon the recommendation of several people, I tried the Ginger O's and was pleasantly surprised.

I don't really review games, because videogames are nothing much to talk about.   ---  --- But anyway, these obe star reviewers are all idiots.

The people who write one star reviewers are all stupid fragile Hilary Clinton Supporters ans support that stupid dumbf*** jack thompson. Freaking imbeciles.   ---  --- Okay now, this game rules.

I just wanted top get myu point across to the one star reviewers.   ---  --- If you don't have this, get it, I don't care how, but get it.

Not to be disrespectful but are you people for real? I can't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars. There was nothing good about this book. A bunch of people in the book did not even matter, Bill Kendall's wife, the new anchor man Pete whatever his last name was, the boss Yelena, Eliza's boyfriend, the priest, even the soon-to-be-president and his wife, I mean what's the point in even mentioning them? They were not involved in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much. Really disappointing. As I said I don't mean to be disrespectful, but to give this book 5stars, you must have read either bedtime stories all your life, or not have read anything.  --- DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY that's all i have to say. sorr	neg

My husband and I purchased this bike to replace my 4 year-old son's 12inch toddler bike.  Our son loves that the bike looks like "a big kid's bike" with it's hand brake.  I was concerned that my son wouldn't be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work, but he has had no problems!  In addition, the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards.  This bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes! 	pos

This bench went together quickly.  All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent.  Anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems.  There are a few steps where a second set of hands help.  Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent. ---  --- However, this bench is simply not built for much weight.  It will wobble and flex.  It doesn't feel safe at all.  If you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench.   ---  --- There are alot better benches out there for just a little more money	neg
I definitely understand why this band is classified as emo. This CD helped me solidify the impression I had that I don't care for emo.  ---  --- The album is not bad and the band is tight enough for a young band, but the issue I have with emo and with this album in particular, is it's not really anything. It's not hardcore, it's not really melodic....it's sort of stuck in the middle of both but not quite reaching either one.  ---  --- Maybe I'm not the target audience for emo or this band....I get that, that's ok. I can't stop thinking Thursday seem like they're trying desperately to sound like Fugazi and never really getting there. And that's the rub of it I guess....with bands like Thursday and She Wants Revenge...they appear to be reaching for the roots of alternative/hardcore or newwave music but for someone who knows what the real thing sounds like, they're a poor imitation. The sound is immature and lacks the urgency and edge that the original bands had at the time.  ---  --- I have a friend with a 14 year old son who asked me to burn him a copy of this CD. I think I'll just be giving it to him and calling it done	neg
I picked up a copy of Health at my local grocery store, mostly out of curiosity. I found myself enjoying it enough so that I will be ordering a subscription. Here's why: --- 1.It encompasses every facet of health, not just diet or exercise. As one reviewer noted, it is broken down into categories: Looks, Living, Moving, Feeling, and Flavor (it was just redone). The articles in each seem to be well-written and are enjoyable. I particularly enjoy the Feeling and Living sections, as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines. --- 2. Unlike many other magazines, I found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine. I, like most others, enjoy getting the most for my money. --- While everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a "good" magazine, this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house	pos
They don't collapse, so they aren't the most easily portable as you sure aren't putting them in your pocket.  You also aren't listening to music in bed with them, as mentioned in other reviews, the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears. ---  --- I tend to collect lower end headphones, and why not.  So, I do have a unique perspective on them (or so I say, mostly to flatter myself). ---  --- These, compared to other vertical designs, are good.  The sound is better than most.  Not quite as good as the Sony h.EAR line, but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks.  These p9's are simple, one piece, and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear. ---  --- The volume adjustment makes them nice for Tv and computer use.  Also, if you ever listen while using a splitter, make sure the other person is wearing the cans (or whatever more power consumptiony headphones) so you can cut your volume.  My wife wears cans when watching TV, so when I just MUST watch some witty Sonic commercial, I just plug myself in. ---  --- They aren't perfect.  I'd like to also try the Sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the Sony folding ones.  They did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my Rio Carbon was broken (only volume control on the thing).   ---  --- For reference, my everyday buds are Sony ED21LPs, which I highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out, and can be stored in a very small area.  Heck, I even use the stupid pouch that comes with them. ---  --- But, yeah, knowing the weaknesses of the p9, if you think you'd like it, then you'll love it	pos

This little scanner is not worth the price. It's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use. There is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency, large gaps in between the frequency ranges it's programmed to receive, and very limited memory capabilities. The small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device, looking from any angle and the backlit LCD display is unreadable.  ---  --- Reception of this scanner is poor on all of it's (very limited) bands, though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna. The scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources. The squelch is practically useless on this thing, it's either on or off, it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full, as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it's set just above the static level on any empty frequency. The sound quality from the built-in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding, but at least there is a jack for an external speaker. ---  --- On the bright side, the chassis is well built and strong, the buttons have a decent feel, not to light nor too stiff. The knobs turn with ease, but will not change their settings due to road vibration, they stay put where you set them at. The fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall, but it's not enough to make up for it's lacking feature set and poor performance	neg
I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave. And isn't that what we want in the end?  --- I don't know anyone who buys one of these things for its "ergonomic design features." It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice. Rinse it clean with running water and you're done. That's what I'm looking for. ---  --- The only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running. It seems like it's always needing a charge...but that's how it sounds at full charge. It will take some getting used to I guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus.  --- Also, the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated.	pos
Just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides. You will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them. Given the verbiage on the box, it caught me as enough of a surprise that I returned the scanner. I'm not OK with deception like that	neg

Just about everything negative that can be said about this doll has been said here, but I still feel that I have to put my two cents in.  My daughter will be nine next month and, as always, she wants a Barbie doll for her birthday.  This is one doll that not only will my daughter NOT be getting, but one that she will never even see if I can help it.  Little girls love things that are shiny and sparkly and glitzy, but this doll goes way beyond that.  The doll looks like a [...].  The clothes and makeup just do not make sense in any other context.  Yes, it's just a doll, and it's the parent's responsibility--not the toy company's--to teach kids what is okay and what isn't.

This movie is horrible. I even found the terror that was Jaws: the Revenge better than this. I'll list some of the things that made this movie bad. --- 1. The acting was horrible --- 2. the special effect were even worse than the acting --- 3. The kids were smarter than the adults (thats how you know its a corny kids movie) --- 4. The jokes fell flat every singal time --- 5. The script was horrible --- 6. 95% of the movie you could tell was on a blue screen --- I know they were targeting this movie for younger audiences but get real I've seen alot of family movies that both kids, teenagers, and adults can enjoy. I felt tortured threw this entire movie. I was Praying that it would end and I could leave. Don't buy this movie. Hell don't even rent it. Its just that bad	neg
It is user friendly, transparent, and more robust than Trendmicro's or CA's products, both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working.  For Windows OSes, Onecare is best in my experience.  However, I have not used OneCare's backup feature enough to make  a judgement.  The $49.99 for 3 computers may be okay, but it would be even better if Microsoft offers it for one computer at  1/3 the rate, say at $17/computer per year	pos

I really enjoyed my Nano CHI iron while it lasted (RIP 7/06-11/06), it handles well, it's a great straightener, and it's a pretty color. However, I dropped it approximately two feet, onto a carpeted floor, and it stopped working. I purchased the CHI about four months ago and think that a $120 iron should be a bit more resiliant. I'll still purchase CHI products, but wouldn't recommend investing in the Nano Technology just yet...there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out, and it's not worth having to pay an extra $35 to have it repaired	neg

If you have an ipod or mp3 player, I'd recommend getting this.  I think the baby is going to love it!  I bought it last week, and tested it out (our baby hasn't been born yet).  The speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby's crib or room IMO, and I'm 1/2 deaf.  I also like the little nightlight on it that changes color.   --- My only criticism is that it takes batteries (no AC adapter).  We may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly.  For $20, I think it's great	pos
The pliers do the job & seem to be well made. My only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link. I guess if you remove the band from the watch, it would make it easier. In that case I recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface. BUT...this did do the job (even leaving the band on the watch). It comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out	pos

The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" & "Fanny & Alexander," von Trier's "The Kingdom," Fassbinder's "Berlin Alexanderplatz," Kusturica's "Underground," and Petersen's "Das Boot," The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode may pop up in another).  The stories of The Dekalog are morality plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments, but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two.  Kieslowski & Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's best up & coming director's to do each, as was initially planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories.  I won't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature.  His films often tackle issues of political import, however he intentionally avoids making "issue films," but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in Poland before, during & after the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style.  ---  --- This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that, you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode, very annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be. Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast, so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape.  The picture is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits. The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features, particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no option to turn of the English dub & use subtitles instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The Dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition, which is inexcusable given the price	neg
I bought this out of a cut rack for $3.99. It sat in my CD tower for at least 5 years before I ever really listened to it.I couldn't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and I came close to trading it.I brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.I really like the whole experience. I'm lucky I brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones. I don't know anything about this band,I bought it on a whim,but I'd reccommend this album and I may follow up on this band	pos

I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one	neg
The most simple definition of [...] is sexual gratuitousness. Sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on, not providing anything pertinent to the plot. ---  --- You can't help but get a porno feel while watching Bully. And to think I was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully; but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in. ---  --- Was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl's crotch while she's driving a car? Was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes? You can't help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story. The very first scene is of a guy having phone sex. ---  --- Several things about this movie other than the [...] made me mad: ---  --- 1. You're planning to kill somebody, then proceed to tell everybody, including the waitress at Pizza Hut what you're planning. ---  --- 2. After you kill, you're so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting VERY strange and telling even MORE people what you did. ---  --- 3. Which makes more sense? To decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend, or, to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh-ore. Bobby never put a gun to the guy's head to make him hang out with him, yet murder was the only option? ---  --- 4. I can't believe Mr. Wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy's throat while he's staring him blankly in the face begging for his life. ---  --- 5.

I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope. ---  --- This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.   ---  --- The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks! ---  --- The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful. ---  --- I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects. ---  --- Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored. ---  --- NOT recommended	neg
This is a dream!  Quick-brew _and_ blueberry!  It's slightly slower brewing than plain Lipton quick-brew tea, but it does brew up in about three minutes.  It's definitely blueberry flavored, and it's a little red in color.  For we impatient flavored tea lovers, this is a great product	pos
This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the "sweater" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious "Z" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase.	neg

At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd. ---  --- At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll. ---  --- To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.   ---  --- If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.   ---  --- I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, "If the South Woulda Won," which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song. --- 	neg

To my knowlege, there simply isn't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator.  It's IR-sensitive mode (nightshot) is in B&W (rather than cheeseygreen), far superior quality-wise to anything Sony's got, and it's the only 3CCD that I know of with a low-light mode.  The image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade.  Time/Date stamps can be "burned in" so they xfer via firewire - again, the only camera I'm aware of with this feature.  The audio can be turned off which we know is a must.  And best yet, you can disable the sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on.  It's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand, but it's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame.  Finally, it's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing.   ---  --- The ONLY downside so far as I can tell is it's size - It's a big camera compared to the handicams I've had, and wouldn't be well suited for close-proximity work.  However, the black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly, and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit. ---  --- Highly recommended! --- 	pos

Tony Kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of  "the best" pilots around. His use of case studies of real pilots  and real situations includes examples from the military, commercial, and  geneal aviation communities. In short, the book is useful for any pilot  whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed  as a senior airline captain. For many pilots, it will reinforce what they  already know and practice but for many, it will provide the opportunity to  become "old" pilots.  If you fly, read the book	pos
This is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your Wish List address if you "wish" for magazines. ---  --- My son changed his address in his Amazon account when he moved 2 years ago within the same city. Amazon did not use this information to update his address within his Wish List. When I ordered $138 worth of magazines from his wish list last December, Amazon hid the street address "for privacy" - therefore I could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address.  ---  ---  --- In November, I asked my son if he'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any! ---  --- After I spoke with Amazon, my son now gets a message when he goes to his Wish List that his address doesn't match the one in his account, so it's clear Amazon is now aware of this problem. ---  --- The publisher will not redo this subscription for Luerzers, saying the magazines were never returned to them, and Amazon has not responded to my request for a refund	neg
I bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the Hungry Girl website, and I am glad that I did.  They work well in a number of different recipes, are filling, and add a "calcium boost" to the dishes I use them in, for very few calories.  These are not "pasta" type noodles, of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of "slippery"), and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them.  I probably won't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas, which these are not.  On the other hand, these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai, Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes (basically, noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce).  There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet which are fairly easy to make, taste terrific, and work beautifully with these noodles.  You can prepare yourself a real treat, if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture, and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice.  In short, if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles, you're likely to be disappointed, but if you use them in Pad Thai, any type of curry, other Asian dishes, or most soups, you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal, low-carb meal.  ---  --- One thing - when you open the bag, there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me, anyway).  If you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes, as per the package directions, the odor really does disappear.  It is not a strong odor, it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that, but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them.  Just follow the package directions	pos

The special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period--there's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done. Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer perfection. It's too bad that Doris didn't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like Carol Burnett.	pos
I'm using this in an area where, as usual, there is no map data for the trails and roads. Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness.  ---  --- Basically I bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges, passes, peaks and unknown road systems, while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress. So far it's a 0/5 points in this department.  ---  --- If you want to find your way back to points this is useful, however for other types of navigation involving linear objects, such as trails and roads, waterways the software isn't there yet	neg
One time while in Los Angeles, I had the forward thinking enough to book an appointment with Anastasia because I'd seen her on Oprah and in magazines and knew she was Queen of the eyebrows.  I thought if I had one appointment, I could maintain them afterward myself.  If you live nowhere near Bev Hills or aren't going to be in LA, this is the next best thing.  It's like having her in your home permanently. --- The kit is fantastic.  There are different colours to choose from and it's easy to use.  It does look a little weird at first if you use the colour where there are no brows, but I don't know if everyone can tell, or we girls are just a little more fussy when it comes to ourselves. --- This is the best way to get the perfect shape and it really DOES make a difference to your face.  You'll look better and ultimately feel better.  The stencil is the best invention and I highly recommend it	pos

'Google Advertising Tools: Cashing in with Adsense, Adwords, and the Google APIs' by Harold Davis is one of those specialty books that is absolutely a must have for anyone that wants to succeed with advertising on Google.

I'm not sure who's at the helm of this operation but I'd be willing to bet they don't get Outside too often.

  I write a lot of reviews on books,but seldom write one on a product.However; I feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite.I,like I suppose,just about everyone else,keep looking for the lite that is right for all people,for all purposes.If It exists,I haven't seen it yet.The plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since I got my first as a kid,60 years ago. They often fail you when they are needed,batteries are expensive,but overall they serve a purpose. About 50 years ago ,a hand held magneto lite appeared.As long as you kept squeezing it,it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght.It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle,where it was powered by the turning of the wheel.However; as soon as the bicycle stopped ,the light went out. --- For some reason,they disappeared off the market.A few years ago,a new almost similar magneto lite appeared.The biggest difference is, it made a lot of noise when squeezed.They don't appear to have been very popular. ---  This Faraday principle Lite has been made very popular due to  --- TV ads, More because what they don't say than what they do say,many people are disappointed upon getting one. ---   The ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile.So --- what!,we learned in the military, that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night.So,if that's not you were looking for,it is meaningless to you.In fact,it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away.For this purpose ,it can't begin to compete with a normal flashlight;and if that's what you want,forget it.As a matter of fact,those little LED keychain lites can do just as much;and can be picked up for a buck at the "Dollar Stores". They last for a couple of years,weigh next to nothing,and you'll always have one with you.I Leave them around the house  and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot,or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure.  ---   These lites are so weak you can't assume they will meet your expectations in a store,or from watching a TV ad.My advice is try and compare with a Key Chain lite,one might serve you as well as the other,at a huge difference in cost. 	pos
"Maiden Voyage" appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces, and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward. Nevertheless, the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing. To these ears, this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying. The songs meander without clear structure and Tony Williams' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band. The influence of this album is indisputable, but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter. If you enjoy groundbreaking, cerebral jazz such as the music made by Miles Davis' second quintet, then this album will probably work for you. If, on the other hand, you favor Hancock's earlier and more accessible albums "Takin' Off" and "My Point of View," this album may be a bit of a letdown	neg
We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory. Our son is 18 months old, 48 pounds and 40 inches tall (Yes, we know we got a linebacker on our hands) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so.  We love that the max weight is 70 pounds, but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there, I think??!!.  I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something.  But other than that, the stroller is very sturdy, well-made, and light weight.  It handles like a dream and I wouldn't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco.  It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer, where the Graco did not.  I can't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning.  Oh, and our son loves it too by the way... he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn't get out until we bribed him with a bath, so it must be pretty comfortable.  Definitely worth every dime, we love it.  I can't say enough good things about BOB either, they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too, [...	pos
This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense. This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such, it is great. This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn't meant to be. But when you need some light in an emergency, a little shaking and you have some light. It's starting to dim? Just shake it some more and voila, more light. You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help. --- I don't know why people are giving this bad reviews. This is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working. And if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say, the light will last longer then people on here are saying. If my 6 year old niece can figure it out, I would think that adults could too. But, there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything.  --- This is an emergency, no battery SHAKE flashlight. I think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself.  ---  --- You should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles, campers, boats, kids rooms, etc. How many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn't find new ones? This one has worked everytime I have uesd it. But then again, I do have common sense.  ---  --- This flashlight is Great!	pos
I bought this camera around the beginning of July and have used it several times already.  I've upgrade from a Nikon Coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller, sleaker size and more megapixels.  This camera takes excellent pictures, in broad daylight as well as in the dark.  Red eye reduction is wonderful, however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times.  It's not broken... it's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch.  Overall, I think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation! 	pos
After constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the "Belkin Bozo's"(support). I received a long delayed canned e-mail answer to my problem which didn't help a bit. I finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a Linksys Network Card. Both Linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement. No more dropouts. --- I would suggest that prospective purchasers of Belkin products hesitate before buying.. It's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly, but it's really frustrating when Product Support is worthless	neg

My biz partner and I were excited to receive our first mag from this group.  We were sorely disappointed.  Most of the articles are not new information, but "rehashed" info widely available.

If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.  --- Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book	neg
This truly is a masterpiece of pop music. There is not a wasted moment. The songs all blend together majestically one after the other. You really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect.  ---  --- I agree with the reviewer that stated that 'Don't Look Back' is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays.  ---  --- I don't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart. I had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive.	pos
The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic. You have a regular burner, and a small grill at the same time. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired. ---  --- Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor. Out of the box, paint was flaking, and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit. The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part. ---  --- The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit. ---  --- Reading other reviews I can't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number: the bad kind and the good kind. If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety. --- 	neg
I got this hat because it reminded me of what Jack Nicholson wore in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I'm happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm. Cashmere is very soft and it breathes well (my head never feels too hot)	pos
I suggest that you do a search on this product on infomercial scams dot com. ---  --- Take a look at this review from Channel 2 (KDKA) in Pittsburgh, PA: ---  --- You've probably seen the ad on TV for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler. ---  --- But does it really do that?  ---  --- Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool? ---  --- Diane Black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car.  ---  --- "I am a visiting nurse. I'm in and out of the car all day," Black said. "I hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. So I thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing." ---  --- After shipping and handling, $23 for Auto Cool as seen on TV.  ---  --- The same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car.  ---  --- But does it really do that? ---  --- On a hot day last week, we decided to find out. Inside the Auto Cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping. ---  --- The only thing you need is a pair of scissors. ---  --- Now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun. ---  --- We choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches. ---  --- The solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. No problem there. We hang it on the window, fan side in. ---  --- Next comes the weather stripping. ---  --- So we've installed Auto Cool. Now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees. ---  --- While we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction. ---  --- One hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car. ---  --- We are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. It just got hotter inside.  ---  --- But just to be fair, we test one more car. ---  --- We make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. This time, it's 80 degrees. ---  --- We quickly install auto cool. By now, the temperature is 90 degrees.  ---  --- While Diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. She says it will take about 20 minutes.  ---  --- In the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car. ---  --- Will it work this time?  ---  --- Twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees. ---  --- Maybe if we hadn't used Auto Cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care.  ---  --- Not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far. ---  --- Don't waste your money on this one. 	neg
I received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son. It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and  crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention. The positive features: it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright	neg

I bought my K10D in Dec 06 after owning a number of Pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was "soft" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.  Once again for Pentax, the engineering is supurb.  	pos
I thought Tiny love products were good, so I bought this.  The first one I received had the water leaking out.  The second one doesn't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying.  My baby seems to like it, but it does not live up to what it advertises	neg
Other reviewers have taken pains to outline the "plot" of this baby boomer bodice ripper. Suffice it to say author Kathryn Harrison, scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that "more is better" , offers estrangement between identical twins, loss of a child, incest, paternity confusion, mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused New York shrink. This reader was aching for the hero, Will, to book himself onto Jerry Springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from Ms Harrison like "It's just...it's...What is it? Will doesn't have a word for what he feels." (Perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author, however, should not. In any case, those are lousy, lazy sentences among so many examples.) --- In addition to being insufferably, cartoonishly silly, the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure. Bad things happen to Will-the-shrink, Will then regurgitates them at length to HIS shrink, then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened, what he thinks happened, and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks.  --- As for Ms Harrsion's "famous" sex scenes. They practically lie on their backs, fondling their adverbs and panting for Penthouse approval: "She's unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly, almost unnaturally, slippery." --- "Envy", by the way, is Ms Harrison's 11th book and she should, by now, be getting things more right than wrong	neg
I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly	neg

I can't speak to how well the product performs because mine was DOA.  Customer Service was unable to do anything over the phone.

I tried the apple cider clarifying shampoo on a reccomendation from a saleswoman at Sephora.  I have never been happier with a shampoo.  I have fine/ oily hair and product buildup is a problem for me.  After using this, it felt like I just left a salon.  My hair was shiny, squeaky clean, it had body and was sooo soft.  I also got several comments from people at work about how good my hair smelled. I only use it about once a week, not only to conserve (it is pretty pricey per ounce), but also it's clarifying so I don't want to dry out my scalp (this has happened to me before).  So I shampoo and condition with other products during the week	pos

I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.   ---  --- If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all.

This series is a travesty. I understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura, not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions, the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers. There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not fiction.	neg
I finally had to upgrade my old faithful 35-year-old Schumacher 6 amp charger - not because it quit working, but because it didn't have enough horsepower to handle the big 105 ampere-hour trolling motor battery in my boat. I wanted a higher capacity unit, but with the same solidly built reliability I've experienced with my old Shumacher charger. This unit was priced quite a bit less than some other brands with similar capability, so I was a little afraid Schumacher, like many companies, might have gone the "cheap" route with their products by using a lightweight case and cheap components. Not so! I was pleasantly surprised to find this is a solid, heavy, well built charger in the best Schumacher tradition. Well designed with a very stout plastic cabinet with pop-up carrying handle, informative and easy to use front panel controls, and nice features like automatic no-spark battery connecting/disconnecting even if you forget to unplug it first, plus automatic polarity protection, and a looong power cord with a handy place to store the cord. I found only a single minor negative:  If I had to change anything about this unit, I'd find a quieter fan. The fan, although it's pretty loud for it's size, is at least automatic and only runs when needed, so this is no big deal to me, since I only run it in my shop/garage. Haven't tried the "start" function, which I consider a more or less useless frill for a charger of this size, but it certainly charges all types of batteries like a champ, and the automatic quick charge/maintenance charge function works great. I highly recommend this great little charger	pos

Do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date.  (The receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days.)

This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism	neg

Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like. 	pos

Nighly stylized movie that uses Sky Captain CPG with an Equilibrium theme.  ---  --- In the future, a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes. I'm good with that part, and Mila Jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `Ultraviolet'. What doesn't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air. There is no explaination how, and the dumbass drones after her don't have the same ability. Personally, I wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded ARMY of top notch killers! ---  --- The whole film is shot in CG touches a la Sky Captain and The World Of Tommorrow. This supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world's `vampire' problem. In reality, it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography. ---  --- Normally, I would have given this a 1 star. Poor piece of film. Period. BUT, after the Resident Evil series, I felt MJ did a very nice job here. Thus the 2 stars.  ---  --- Do not buy, but wsit until it is on cable, which I did.

This game was a lot of fun, you can do so much and the dark humor was great.  The only gripe I have is that it was just way to short and easy.  I easily beat this game in about 3 days, and I still have 2 days left on my rental.  I would say rent this game, because you can easily beat it within a week.   ---  --- So overall, here is a break down of the Pros and Cons. ---  --- Pros: --- -Playing pranks on students  --- -The missions are a lot of fun --- -The side missions are also a lot of fun, bring more to the story --- -Good Dark Comedy, like all other Rockstar games --- -Unlocking funny constumes, like the black ninja costume to stay out past curfew --- -All the different Cliques were great, and being able to beat up and bully anybody is a lot of fun ---  --- Cons: --- -Just way too easy, the missions can be beaten very easily. --- -Incredibly short, nothing like the Grand Theft Auto Games where it can take a month to unlock everything, I was able to unlock everything in 3 days. --- -Would've loved to see some of the same things from GTA:SA in Bully.  EX: In GTA:SA you are able to have gang members follow you and do what you want.  It would've been great to see that in Bully. ---  --- Overall:  I would suggest renting, a lot of fun, but easily beaten, not worth $50	pos

I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks.  The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature.  It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it.  After much frustration trying to get "to" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all.  The internal battery is soldered in place.

I have searched high and low to find a high-quality sugar free, dairy free chocolate bar that tasted just like the real thing, and I can honestly say that these amazing chocolate bars fit the bill perfectly!  Ross Chocolates has truly done it--I could not tell the difference between these and the kind made with sugar and dairy.  These dark chocolate bars are perfect for anyone looking for a pure, healthy alternative to the standard sugar-laden chocolate bar out there.  I am hypoglycemic, so normal sugary candy isn't an option for me.  These bars, though, have no impact on my blood sugar--in fact, I feel even better after eating them and have no negative reactions whatsoever!  They are also perfect for people who are allergic to dairy (like myself) because they are completely dairy-free.  As an added bonus, each bar contains 3 grams of fiber!  The bars have a wonderul, fresh crunch to them, with none of the strange aftertaste common to some products sweetened with sugar alcohols.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between these maltitol-sweetened bars and those sweetened by regular sugar.  Enjoy	pos
Having used Turbo Tax since 1990 I feel that I am qualified to comment on it. --- I have also used Quicken, Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Home & Business, QuickBooks Pro 2003 & QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition. The Turbo Tax product seems to get more user UN-FRIENDLY each year.  The navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's.  Like I said I WAS using QuickBooks Pro 2003 until tax time last year.  I purchased Turbo Tax Home & Business like I had for the past 4 years, and really got a shock when I found out that it would not import my data from QuickBooks Pro 2003.  Three year old software that was not compatible with Turbo Tax in 2006(actually 2005 tax year).  I ended up purchasing QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition 2006  --- ($280+) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done.  Intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed.

The first problem I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box. ---  --- Both connectors were covered by labels, which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off.

He speaks to 3 or 4  truckdrivers, 2 or 3 shopkeepers, and a few assorted others, from which he  assembles a complete picture and understanding of the Political and Social  infrastructure of Iran.  Along the way he explains, on just about every  other page, how the CIA is a complete failure in every facet of it's  existence, how all the career people in it's employ are arrogant idiots who  are devoid of all compassion and intellect.  He explains each of the Cia's  mistakes, along with his explanation of what they ought to have done. He  is, of course, ex CIA himself, having left it because no one there  understood anything about anything	neg

On a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. You can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top. ---  --- For value of product, Jonathan gets a 1. ---  --- For quality of product 3. ---  --- The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price	neg
Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe. ---  --- At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box. --- But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe. ---  --- Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement.

 OK this isnt really a review but more of a reaction to another review, which in my opinion was written by no child.  It's just a doll...get over it.

Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now. 	neg

I am really liking this magazine already because it focuses particularly on multicultural and biracial marriages, brides, grooms, weddings, everything! ---  This mag focuses on brides of every color and overall just average brides in general.  There is focus on how to incorporate dierent heritages into the details of the wedding from the gown to the reception.  I also really enjoyed the little feature on biracial celebrity pairs and of course the gorgeous ring and gown spreads! --- I definitely recommend this magazine if you are in a biracial relationship, blending two cultures into one wedding (or both!), or maybe you just want tips or ideas so you can plan a unique around the world cross cultural wedding just for fun.  If an all white wedding is not for you in more ways than one than this is the magazine to pick up	pos
I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, "an idiot.") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer	pos

Dr. Scholl's Pedicure Essentials Cracked Skin Repair Cream had a very nice smell and felt good. However, the long-term effects weren't what I expected.

My bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light. ---  --- I received the Tranquility Zone eye mask for a birthday present and I could hardly wait to try it. I LOVE this thing! It's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and, due to the design, the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears. The sounds are pleasant (I'm a big fan of the "Babbling Brook" track) and I love being able to plug my mp3 player in so I can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks, too.  ---  --- I've given this 5 stars because there's no option for 4.5. In all honesty, there are a few drawbacks. First, when I say this is thick I'm not kidding. Without my A/C in the summer it might get a bit warm. Second, the sound clips themselves are on very short loops... so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you're hearing you'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so. Were it not for this I'd be a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like you're in a forest -- but I get distracted (and awakened) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades. ---  --- Even with these things in mind, I have to say I haven't slept this well in YEARS. I love this thing, and I wish I'd found it earlier. In fact, I love it so much I've given it as a gift to two friends who'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it, too	pos
The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through. ---  --- The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book. ---  --- The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's Child".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home! --- 	neg

Now let's get its effectiveness out of the way so we can talk about that love it or hate it scent! It is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days. I have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends, and it leaves my hair shiny. It isn't greasy at all.  ---  --- If you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners, don't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month. That is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair (silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in "cone", like dimethicone, etc). Detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though, my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup. ---  --- So the scent: It is green, kind of melon and fresh, with a hint of violet (like Bathos, Gratuitous Violets, and Daddyo) to it. It took some getting used to, and when I first got it I thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable-like smell. But when you use it and rinse it out, you are left with a rich green scent, with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet.  ---  --- It isn't for everybody, but if you buy it, give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement, because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive. I use it with Daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent I get from it. I use it in rotation with American Cream which is a bit lighter	pos
I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around. ---  --- I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor X 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway.	pos

I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.   ---  --- Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.   	neg
There is no comparing the incredibly honest reviews on Amazon with the high-brow reviews found in the LRB.

I bought the cooler for my Dell Inspiron which tends to get hot because I work it so hard - it's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically, is very sturdy yet light enough for me. --- So I bought another (wide-screen)(black) version for my HP Pavilion which has more RAM and so doesn't have to work that hard, now its internal fan virtually never kicks in.   --- In both cases the fan is so quiet that I have to turn it on/off to make sure that it is working. --- The only improvement I would suggest is more usb ports. --- 4 stars because 5 is perfection	pos

Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say "USA" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee," only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a "handling fee" attached. ---  --- I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect. ---  --- My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore.	neg

Amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product.  Usually I like to have actually used the product before writing a review, but since I haven't received it yet, that is not possible.  It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com.  Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now.  I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user.  I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon.  I hear DV cable does it's job, but I'll have to wait and see	neg
Very disappointed.  Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time.

I've had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just love it! I am very new to all this fancy cell phone stuff, the last one I had was bare bones basic. It is great having a phone that you can do so much with. The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have. The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it, I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadn't made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deal it was. You just can't beat a one cent phone with free shipping and $75.00 in rebates! T-Mobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in 2 days! The customer service people have been so nice and the ability to buy ringtones, wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from T-Zones is awesome. I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account & plan info right on the phone. I am very impressed. The only issue I have been having is finding accessories for it-my usual discount accessory shops don't have much yet-I'm assuming because the phone is so new, but I'm sure that will get resolved soon. Buy this phone, it is great	pos
 ---  ---  ---       I was reading this magazine at work, and I consider it to be a trashy magazine. It only focuses on the sexual part of women, like if sex is the best thing in the world, because they had this article in which a girl was riding a taxi, and she thought the taxi guy was fine, so she unbutton her shirt and told the taxi guy to touch her breasts. And then she says it was the *best experience she ever had. --- I just cant believe they publish garbage like that, giving the message to women that its ok to undress yourself with a total stranger, who you dont even know. --- I prefer to read things that focus more on the inner heart, on the emotional, and spiritual side of things. And read books that will help me be a better person right now and the future, and throw away the garbage this society has	neg

I used to love Light & Tasty, then they decided to change the look and format, even though reader surveys said keep it the same.  The new look is hard to read, and lacks the down-home feel that makes the magazines popular.  There are less pictures of the finished dishes, and the pictures they do show are smaller.  They added full page ads for thier country store products, which goes against the no ad promise.  I have subscribed for years, but this new look is horrible.  Get it at the store to see if you like it first	neg
This is the perfect CD for taking a nap to. It's mostly full of slow pop and rock. If you're a fan of this type of music, I recommend this CD, but if not, don't buy it.

Set in Venice at the end of World War II, Hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old American colonel and Renata, a young and very pretty Italian contessa.  Loss is a recurring theme--the death of many of the Colonel's subordinates in combat, the break-up of his earlier marriage to a career woman, and the severe injury to one of the Colonel's hands from which he suffers constant pain.  The Colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short. ---  --- What gives the novel so much poignancy and resonance is the great devotion Renata and the Colonel have for one another.  Renata seeks to comfort the Colonel and implores him to relate to her the worst of his combat experiences so that he may relieve some of his bitterness.  The Colonel lovingly calls Renata, "daughter." ---  --- Hemingway tells this tale in the deceptively simple, direct, and matter of fact style for which he is justly celebrated.  I could have done without the duck hunting sequences and some of the Colonel's more obvious macho behavior, but Hemingway, being Hemingway, understandably could not. ---  --- This is a lovely and sad story, filled with the yearnings of its two lead characters	pos
WARNING: MOVIE SPOILER BELOW!!! --- I confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film, is grounded in recent history. I was around in the early 80s, when L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientologists were going full-bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie (the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like Chuck Norris, or so I thought), when all of a sudden Hubbard died, and the whole project apparently fell apart. Back then, I was close to 20 years old and I was curious about whatever it was that these Scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person's quality of life... then I read about Larry Wollersheim's 1985 lawsuit. You can figure the rest out for yourself. ---  --- Anyhow, oh, yeah, the movie... the storyline is your basic alien invasion number, i.e., the Invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans (in this film, the aliens look a lot like the Klingons from Star Trek), until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the Invaders to get off of our planet. Pretty simple and straightforward, but hey, there are other films MUCH worse than Battlefield Earth, and they've taught me that if you have good enough special effects, even the lamest sci-fi storylines can work! ---  ---  --- The thing that stood out about this film, though, was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue, and as a result, it came across as rather corny... a film to be recommended for its comedy value, rather than for things like epic space battle scenes. Also, the "bad guy" aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects, in order to keep them from organizing revolts... I must say, trying to depict mind-manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a CD---it turns it into a confusing, incomprehensible mess! A couple of times, the picture would break up into a concentric blur, and I'd wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on. ---  --- How the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like Warner to help them film it, is something which will forever remain a mystery to me. I remember just before this picture opened, a group of Scientologists were trying to hype it: "oh, watch---this film is going to be bigger than Star Wars and Gone With the Wind combined!" You can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized... can you say "oops"	neg
I REALLY like using this product. The color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle. I like using this after I have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older.

There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation. ---  --- I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle. ---  --- Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling.  I have saved the two (2) metal shavings. ---  --- I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed. ---  --- Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it.  The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00.	neg

This is a perfect winter cream for me, and would probably work for anyone else who has very dry skin (e.g., you rub Eucerin on at night).  It is very similar to the regular cream in appearance (pink) and smell (not offensive), but it is much heavier.  I started using this during the winter when I discovered the regular cream wasn't heavy enough and it works just as well.  It spreads on pretty easily for such a thick cream and when I wake up my skin is dewy and moisturized. 	pos

If you are expecting clear professional sound transmission, this is not it.  That's a wireless system costing $1,000 - $3,000.  This  system is strictly for home none professional use.

I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better.

I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006	neg
I bought this just to try something new.  I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good.  I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate.  I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey.  12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars?  It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way.  The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost.  But now I know, this drink is not for me.  If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you! 	neg
This is a cheap plastic (except for the metal tube)toy. It's like those hand claws for kids. You squeeze the handle and the claw closes. The grabber part on this thing has a 2 1/2" opening.

On the inside of the fingers, they have rubber pads that are removable (probably for cleaning) but they seem to come off on their own	neg

I have an Almansa 435 Seniorita, which is a very lovely little classical guitar, so I have some idea what a decent classical guitar should sound like. I got this little one for my son, who is 5, and didnt want to spend much because you know how children can be when it comes to lessons and instruments. I was very surprised at the quality of the sound. It is still in it's breaking in period, so the strings are still stretching, but it sounds really, really, nice. I even played on it myself (you know, just to get it warmed up for my son!) and it truly is not bad. Doesnt sound "tinny" or "toyish". Sounds like a classical guitar. Now I bought a much more expensive one a few years ago for my daughter, who has since given up the guitar, and that was handmade in mexico, solid wood, 3/4 size, and didn't sound nearly as good as this little thing. For this price, you get a solid spruce top, the finish is nice, kind of matted, the tuners are pretty good, and so far the strings aren't too bad. The base strings look like they could be silver-plated. Unfortunately you dont get any product information in the box so who knows where the strings came from and what kind they are (the guitar is romanian), but the main thing is that the guitar sounds so nice that a child will be encouraged to continue, the teacher will be pleased, and the parents will not have to suffer from more than the usual beginning-any-instrument "noises", and perhaps a lot less because it has such a pleasant sound.  Now of course it isnt comparable to the almansa or to finer guitars, but for a young child who is serious about wanting to study classical guitar, this is a very fine instrument at an EXCELLENT price. This model is sold on other sites for about 20 dollars more, but why pay that?! If you are looking for a small guitar for your young child, this one is a very good bet. A real, very decent sounding, classical guitar for the price of a toy one	pos

I have owned the video for several years and just purchased the DVD.  Hannah and Her Sisters far exceeds Anne Hall as my favorite Allen picture.  Such a joy.  And the DVD is wonderful	pos
I am not an expert in anything. I am an emergency room nurse though, and I hear stories of babies dying from SIDS.  We thought we'd try this product as the reviews are great. We love it. The sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration! I would highly recommend this for every baby, as SIDS is a risk up until 12 months of age. I feel so much better, knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing. We plan to take this with us when we travel. It is easy to use and it really works. If you buy the one with the two parent units, you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead, or as well	pos
I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot	pos
I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible. ---  --- My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end. ---  --- On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films. ---  --- Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie	neg
I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it. There wouldn't have been much difference between the two. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I want to get rid of mine, since it's brand new, but I threw away the box so I can't return it. And I absolutely cannot, in good concience, sell it to anyone else for their child. So, I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did!	neg
I had a Palm TX which I loved, but didn't like having to go to WiFi sites for the web. I also had a Moto V557 phone which is the best cell phone I've ever owned.  I purchased the Treo for the best of both worlds. ---  --- I like the Treo 680, but I had to read all of the instructions, call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone.  For example, I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button. (Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone.) ---  --- I like the web because it's fast enough that I don't miss the WiFi.  I had to get used to the fact that many web sites aren't small enough for the phone, but it's excellent for using Google maps, looking up business and giving the number for easy dial (just tap the blue line), checking bank accounts, online orders, movies, weather and especially the news.  Email is good too with the Palm software. I didn't use Express or GetGood email.  I absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging. ---  --- Now, the phone is another story. I miss the ease of dialing a traditional cell.  My Bluetooth does not work well with the 680. People typically tell me that they can't hear me so I now use a corded ear bud.  The Bluetooth doesn't work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately.  You can't insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions.  There is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number.  You have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial.  The phone dials slowly if there are other programs running. And lastly, you can't check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone. You have to hang up with the person, unlock the phone, check the calendar and call them back. ---  --- The battery life is poor, but I keep a charger in the car which helps a great deal. ---  --- All in all, I love my Treo 680. I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend. They are: Launcher X(excellent), Mobil Write, Treo Voice Dialing, The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows. ---  --- I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a security password.  I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this $400 phone	pos

We received this toy as a gift when our son was born.  It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries.  When I went to put it back onto the crib, I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break.  I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all.  Also, like other reviewers have stated, the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that's when my son started interacting with it, so it's a little age-inappropriate. ---  --- I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement...I'll repost if I hear from them. --- 	neg
I watched this movie, not because I am into Ms. Milano, or her breasts, but because it was shot (sadly) at my high school--Shattuck-St. Mary's School in Faribault, MN. Doesn't say much for the school, or for the faculty who had bit parts in it.	neg
I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then.  The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far.  I always left my V2000 in the vehicle, although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot.  The V2000 has visible at all situations.  I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000's automatic backlight, and see it clearly on a sunny day.  Finding a good place to put the temperature probe, however, is a hassle if you want to get accurate results.  Calibration was also a hassle for me.  You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings.   	pos

Originally looked to buy the WASA Light Rye, but it was out-of-stock. So, bought the Sourdough Rye and Multi Grain instead, and glad I did because they have broadened my selection of favorite WASA brand crispbreads. And while I normally avoid products with yeast, I feel that the toasty crispness of the Multi Grain has neutralized any negative aspects (that yeast is a negative is my story, and I'm stickin' to it!) that may be derived from containing yeast. As for varied uses, it's equally great for strengthening the teeth (and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast, and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten) when eaten as a cracker, or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes. Oh, some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads, which means what's inside is edible for humans too. I keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable. Should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well. Still my preference among all the WASA crispbreads is the light rye. Only 2 ingredients, rye flour and sea salt. Just give me the simple life... without the two accompanying airheads, that is.	pos

Like the other reviewer, I have this clock in my office - in my case in the middle of a warehouse. ---  --- Within 2 minutes the atomic clock had connected and set the time and date.  It has been in wireless contact ever since (there is an icon to let you know) ---  --- The time numerals are a little over 2" high and very clear - easy to read from 50' away.  The day, date and temp displays are about an inch tall and also very clear, but since they are so much smaller they don't have quite the distance visability. ---  --- It is nice to have a clock around that is always right - keeps my meetings on time - no arguement over whose watch is correct	pos
I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out.  I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less.  Where are all the projects?  Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone.  For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2!  The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background.  (At least you won't need much ink).  In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself.  Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send. 	neg
I found La Ciudad a very different movie from any other movies I have wathched. This movie is split into four narratives of Latino immigrants living in the city of New York. Immigrants come to the US with many dreams in their minds. These dreams include getting higher education or getting thier childeren higher education, getting rich, and living a happy and high standard life. This movie shows how these dreams of immigrants are turned down and broken because of the exploitations at thier workplace and the laws of the city and the government. This movie also shows how the immigrant children are affected from these laws and exploitations. For example, Luis's daughter Dulce cannot get addmission to school, and Ana cannot do anything to treat her ill daugheter who is not with Ana. I like it how the movie is shown in black and white; it really matches with the narratives that are shown in the movie. It also indicates that although immigrants hope to have happy and colorful lives in the US, they are not able to have them because of the laws and exploitations. Overall, I really liked the movie and I would encourage anyone to see it	pos
I purchased a SanDisc 4 GB SDHC card for my camera. At the time it did not occur to me that neither my SanDisc Image Mate 6 in 1 nor my SIIG 18-in-1 Reader/Writer would not be able to read this new version of Secure Digital. Long story short-I called IOGear tech support and was assured that this reader would work although netiher their promotional materails nor their packaging indicates that it will. Bottom Line: It works and it was a very inexpensive ($10 at CompUSA) solution to my problem. --- 	pos
I had this for about 2 years, and was not impressed.  It worked for a month or so, and since then, does nothing.  If you fill it up with water, and then plug it in for several days, the water level never goes down.  I've tried cleaning it repeatedly, and tried various things to make it work, but apparently it's just dead.  It was a cheap product; you get what you pay for	neg
i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume!  --- like all the LUSH bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong STRONG smell.  --- i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore. --- so yeah, if you love love LOOOOOOOOVE patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one. --- i love LUSH, but not this bar	neg

I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.   ---  --- I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick	neg
I just bought this doll @ Toys R Us and I was also able to purchase The Hilary Duff Shopping Sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister Haylie Duff which isn't available yet. I have the two other Hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a Lizzie McGuire doll which doesn't look much like Hilary at all. Then there was the Hilary dolls released by Playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll. Now Mattel has made a doll of Hilary Duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll I've seen. And the clothes and accessories are really cute too. I think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too. I'm just waiting for the Haylie Duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. The dolls are available @ Toys R Us, KB Toys, Wal-Mart all under $20.00.	pos
A great idea, in theory, but I think this is a very poor design.  The wing nuts do not tighten sufficiently to hold the strings in place - they just spin around and around.  I will be able to get it working, with a bit of work and a few bits and pieces from around the house, but if I had given this to a child for Christmas I would feel awful about it..	neg

The magazine has great, quality pictures and some interesting articles.   ---  --- The pictures of some golf courses are amazing and very professional. ---  --- I love reading this magazine in my spare time.  Yes, the magazine is for golfers who always tended to have higher incomes.  Golf  was always an expensive sport anyway. ---  --- For golf instructions, I recommmend                          THE ULIMATE GOLF INSTRUCTION GUIDE: KEY TECHNIQUES FOR BECOMING A ZERO HANDICAP GOLFER OR BETTER.  This is written by Patrick Leonardi ---  --- I wanted to share with other readers because this book made my golf game get much better.  If you are like me, I was stuck around the same handicap.  However, this book got me playing much better golf. ---  --- For golf equipment, I definitely recommmend PING IRONS.  Great feel and distance with these clubs.  For putters, I also recommend PING.  They are the best.  The ball putts straight and true.   The feel is natural and unforced.	pos
This is my second item of this type, and in the wintertime it is indepensible. With no garage to keep my SUV in, this cover fills the void.

The service from iGourmet is impeccable ---  --- Everything arrived in perfect condition i.e. ripe (and therefore "stinky" just like it should be!!) ---  --- The Styrofoam packaging was the perfect vessel for delivery; the cheese arrived "alive" from not being over chilled. ---  --- I have not had cheese of this quality outside France, and this is the first time I have found "perfect" cheese in the US. ---  --- If you like top quality "stinky" cheese this is for you........	pos

My daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for Christmas.  The commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids, no more scissors!  Well we opened it today and it's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything.  I'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too!  They should have made it that the "pen" cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something.  I have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it wasn't all that easy for him either.  Seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use	neg
Unlike other oriental noodles you buy, this product has superb flavors and great noodle quality that does not break down.

I installed this today though I haven't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy. I was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo, but after getting it and installing it, it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me. It also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat. I'm giving the chair five stars because I can't think of anything negative about it	pos

Don't listen to the uneducated reviews here. These are great for hitting the heavy bag, speed bags, focus mitts, etc. The length of these, 108", makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves. The 170-180" are for sparring and competitive bouts. That is why Ringside makes different lengths. There is also a 120" length, which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps	pos

We bought this clock to use indoors. Living in Florida, our power service isn't always reliable - especially during hurricane season. So having a battery-operated, atomic clock is perfect for us! ---  --- When folks visit, they always comment on how nice the clock looks. The bronze finish is muted, and it doesn't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures. ---  --- And for $45 and no shipping, we couldn't beat the price on ebay, overstock.com, or any onther online companies. ---  --- In other words, we're very pleased with our purchase	pos
The fastest way to KNOW your plastic baby wares are CLEAN!  I love these bags.  Note, I use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster, since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping. ---  --- You do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item BEFORE steaming it for best results. ---  --- Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product, it has been a lifesaver to me	pos
Extremely disappointing. Bought the toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't come with the battery ($30 extra) and the battery is still sold out everywhere, including online, almost a month later.  ---  --- Don't bother. There are lots of other great RC toys out there	neg
I watched this with some trepidation, and I have to say it was both better and worse than I thought it would be.  It was better because it remained fairly true to the original, in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending.  It was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original, and I found Stone's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting. ---  --- A couple of things kept me viewing this DVD.  One was the London setting, which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns.  The other was Sharon Stone's rather plucky performance, and the presence of Charlotte Rampling, who has aged into a different kind of beauty.  Morrisey doesn't even come close to filling Michael Douglas's shoes, and it's hard to feel sorry for him at the end. ---  --- As with the first movie, you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made.  The basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one.  However, both movies were quick to abandon Hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex.  There's nothing wrong with either of these things, but here they just get in the way	neg
Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting. --- We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it.  It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement. --- There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well.  The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old.  Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up! --- It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat. ---  --- After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood)	neg

This second part of Xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part, regardless of what anyone says.  I no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes. ---  --- The game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non-intuitive battle system.  Annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy, including the very first one.  Battle result and saving screens are a painful chore. ---  --- Battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets.  The game has very few items, weapons, or armor to deal with even ordinary enemies, which are stronger than expected.  The skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy.  Battles with main enemies are long, which isn't such a problem.  However, they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle, just to frustratingly finish off a battle-weakened party. ---  --- Voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying.  I don't remember any music from this game, so plain it is.  Some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first Xenosaga.  Very noticeable is the use of swearing, which is the main reason I don't enjoy or watch Hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore. ---  --- New, meaningless characters have been introduced into the story, and the focus shifted far away from the main characters.  The cover character hardly says or does anything this time.  There is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment, but if you blink you will miss it. ---  --- This game is far more frustrating than challenging, which is not a good game trait.  I don't recommend even playing this game before reading the above, to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits.  If you're looking forward to anything that made the first Xenosaga great, you will be extremely disappointed.  The second Xenosaga is better completely avoided.	neg
I bought this case for use at work. I work in a semi-dusty shop environment. I'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well.

All in all a fine product.  Has gotten excellent reviews from PC MAG. ---  --- Norton slowed my machine to a crawl.  This has not. ---  --- Suggest NEVER paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to.  I've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up. ---  --- It does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web.  For a non techie, this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage	pos

If you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides (less than 10 miles) then this is probably not a bad bike. BUT, if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike, and one that will fit your body properly, go to your local bike shop and ask to see their "hybrid" bikes. This type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a "road bike" and a "mountain bike" or "all terrain" bike. They are available in several frame sizes, so you're not stuck with "one-size-fits-all", which is NOT good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10. Hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections. The price will range from just over $200 to as high as you want to go (over $1500 anyway). As the price goes up, the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up. But even at the low end of the scale, a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride (more miles covered per energy expended) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides (over 10 miles). If you are truly interested in covering some longer distances (up to maybe 30-40 miles) focus on the models that feature 700C wheels as opposed to 26-inch--your bike shop person can explain--and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under (28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement). The narrower tires offer less "rolling resistance" making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also. ---  --- Happy peddaling, --- A VERY experienced cyclis	neg

If you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always Huge to more then make up for the difference.

Just trying to even out the review, I didn't think the other review was fair	pos

Amazon[.com] recommended this game for me, based on the fact that I love the game Set.  Unfortunately Xactika bears a strong resemblance to "10 to 1," a game played with a normal deck of cards.  If you already know how to play "10 to 1," Xactika may seem derivative.  After trying Xactika once or twice, we threw it in the drawer and just played "10 to 1" instead	pos
I got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress.  It was pretty pungent, but it felt so good the first time I layed in it.  after a couple days it appeared to lose it's memory and start to dent and crease, but eventually it got back to full expansion.  The customer service with this item was fantastic! ---  --- We'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory	pos
As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time.  Ultra Chill series 1-4 was outstanding.  While Ultra Chill 05 is not a complete disaster, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating.  Quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs.  Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.  There is a lot of Jazz and Latin chill on these two discs, which I also like, but the Jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great. ---  --- I think the person that rated this 5 stars doesn't own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please.  I'm very dissapointed.  Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh well... --- I'm off to listen to "Chillout Seesions 8"... Hopefully it will be a lot better.  I highly reccomend Chillout seesions by Ministry of Sound.  Chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding... Time to go listen to the new 8!	neg
Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again	neg
We bought this crib online & couldn't be more pleased.  The shipping was great - a few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable.  The directions aren't bad - but they could be a lot better/clearer.  We also bought the matching change table & it looks great in the baby's room. Net, great value for a great product!	pos
At first I thought it difficult to justify the added expense for paper, but you do get good quality. One reviewer comments on stains; but after buying and using 5 or 6 different moleskines, I have to believe that was an exception that would have been replaced. --- I like the Reporter Style for writing quickly or with limited space, but I like the bookmark that is on the standard notebooks	pos
Purchased a total of 20 of these.  --- I previously sold the American International brand Sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market. --- Four of the twenty Terk brand units were dead on installation. Sadly, I thought Terk was a quality brand. My mistake!	neg
These are basic, simple earrings of exceptional quality given the price.  You would likely pay far more for comparable items elsewhere	pos

I bought Vista to get the inevitable familiarity over with as early as possible and what I discovered was an operating system not even close to being compatible yet. Half if not 80% of all routers are not Vista-ready yet, so you can't get a network running for at least a few more months. Any accesories you own with your system no longer work unless they're compatible.. (ie, printers, scanners, burners, etc) so you not only buy an operating system, you have to buy an entirely new set of hardware to go with it. Majority of my programs did not work with Vista, be it Adobe software, Maya, Poser and God forbid any games you own like Warcraft. For the expense and complete hassel, it's not worth owning until eveything is "Ready" (which will probably be a year from now) Save your money. - I returned my copy	neg
This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing. 	neg
I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the $20 coupon and as usual, scored with free shipping. Clarks' quality is tops and the prices were great, too! ---  --- I got these in earth color. They look really good with jeans. Comfy with or without socks. The soles are gonna last a while. ---  --- These have some nice cush to them, and provide good support to my high-arched, tired feet	pos
These Wellies (rubber boots) are a show-stopper! I get lots of comments on how smashing they look - and they are very functional - I wear them in the garden, on the beach (can walk into pretty high water without getting wet) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking. ---  --- Very happy with them and the price was right too	pos
The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate	pos
The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory. ---  --- The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends.  I would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst (yes even worse than this!)	neg
The sounds were very convincing, I actually felt like I was there even my daughter thought it was really storming outside since I have a Subwoofer and was able to control the thunder intensity (all this was at night) the only thing missing was the strobe light to add to the lightnig effect.

There are other types of stress management cd's out there but if you like the outdoors and your'e not able to get away then this is what may work for you. --- Johnny Lina	pos
Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when "the stuff" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it. --- What I learned from The Stuff: Dairy products are evil! Especially if they come from with in the earth! --- If you like The Stuff, I recommend: Watching other B-movies, such as Island of the Alive 3, Zombi 3 and 4, etc	neg

The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places, which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company.  A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched.  The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire.  A required tool, a 5mm allen wrench, was not provided. I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated, however, the bike seems to perform adequately as is.	neg
This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales. ---  --- But *I* don't want to be nice.  I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to Malmsteen. ---  --- He knows alternate picking, I'll give him that.  But then, so do I - and a million others.  He shouldn't be up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most (not all) people .  And yet he is. ---  --- He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than about a second.  And this is an *average* figure. ---  --- Enough about Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review - Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry Night'. ---  --- Vai, though, steals the show.  This coming from a guy who prefers Satriani.  But I can't help it - he is really that good.  And better.  'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you're taught at guitar school.  It is also the best song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'.  ---  --- 'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really really good. ---  --- Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably skip the parts with Yngwie in it	pos
The pieces of this toy (the outfits, etc.) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet.  Also, the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing. In general, this toy is hokey and cheap.  I recommend Melissa and Doug's Magnetic Dress-Up and/or --- Magnetic Princess Dress-Up. All the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together.  Also, the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized. 	neg

The authors have done an excellent job in explaining testing methodologies for component based software.

I highly recommend it for both students and software professionals.	pos

I thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot. It was terrible.

This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining. The people who like it must be quite thin, indeed.  ---  --- It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn't breathe very well, either.  ---  --- I am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices, though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me.  ---  --- For the price, you can do better, even at someplace like Target	neg
I used my last little smokey at least 3 days a week 6 mounths of the year here in MN for 18 years. I am only cooking for two so it works out perfect because you get the preformance of a Webber but you use verry little charcoal. Don't forget to shut the vents when you are done cooking, this smuthers the coals then you can just add about half as much as you would otherwise need next time. Getting a chimney gets your charcoal ready with only newsprint as your starting aid in about 10 minutes. As far as preformance goes you can't beat a Webber you can grill (no lid extreamly hot), or you can smoke or bake with the lid on. Read the cook book that comes with your grill and you will be an expert in no time. The only negative is they replaced the wooden handle with plastic.	pos

Got the mat for free for ordering the Series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped.  It is made by this rubbery plastic, and it's just okay.

Works fine. Difficult to connect but connects securely. Comes with an unlabeled cd (couldn't tell one side from the other) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers, though the tones aren't labeled in any helpful way. I was impressed.

A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.

Ken Russell is a gifted director, as his erratic career has proved, but even the great Vanessa Redgrave can't save this one. "The Devils," a gaudy, loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism, went painfully awry. Grisly images of plague victims, quack cures, peculiar enemas, and Oliver Reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail--unfortunately, they are merely stomach-turning. A stocky, wild-eyed Oliver Reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as Father Grandier, the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century French town, and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake. Gemma Jones is one bright spot as Grandier's innocent love interest, and Ms. Redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of Sister Jeanne, but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart	neg
This high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies.  When screwing together the sections, I managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest.  Any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy.  This toy is very basic, the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth.  Invest in some power tools and make your own, I guarantee it would be better than this one	neg
Wonderful magazine! The receipes are excellent, I have tried several and they are all keepers! They are tasty, low calorie, high fiber etc. The format of the magazine is great and there interesting articles as well as recipes	pos
This magazine compares favorably to "American Heritage" with its interesting and accessible but well-researched accounts of the past. Each issue focuses on a person (I just read the story of Thomas Aquinas--and hadn't realized his fascinating interaction with Muslims) or a movement (The Huguenots, who's sad history led to their dispersal from France to all over the world--including the Revere family moving to Massachusetts). All in all, an intriguing glimpse at how Christians of the past continue to influence us today	pos
This is definitely the inferior rag of the big Trio of Science monthlies. Filled with poorly-written articles. I actually went back to Home Depot once to get a refund for this magazine. It is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine.

The magazine is not a news magazine, it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in. If you like paying for ads, go for it	neg

Following 2002's self-produced and underrated Under Rug Swept, Morissette returns in 2004 with So-Called Chaos. With this release, Morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she's aspiring to take Hollywood by strom but isn't 100% sure. Maybe the new look and image might have worked if Morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it's not. This CD starts out good with the opening cut "Eight Easy Steps," a fast-paced rockin' tune with Alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment. "Out is Through" follows and also stands out, but then So-Called Chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge. And Morissette should never have brought John Shanks or Tim Thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. "Doth I Protest Too Much" is without a doubt the worst song Alanis has ever recorded. The title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by Morissette's lyrics(yes, not her best work)when she refers to heartburn, headaches, and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. The tracks continue with "All of Me," and "This Grudge," both rather dull, while the closing track "Everything" was a weak choice for the first single. Morissette has always been a progressive artist, but So-Called Chaos doesn't measure up to any of its predecessors, and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place.	neg
Good product; however, I don't understand why it requires lengthy updates  --- every time I open the program.   ---  --- Perhaps they should try to get it right the first time.

What I like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total.   Many other mixes make 12 or more, and, if you have a small household, you're stuck with way too many muffins. ---  --- These were better than expected - they are soft, flavorful, and baked perfectly.  Also, use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking. ---  --- It isn't the healthiest food out there, but overall, I'd recommend this mix	pos

I read the reviews of the other buyers while I was purchasing ing this ring. The first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect.

I bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store.  I have used it numerous times on camping expeditions.  It outputs very bright light at full blast.  The lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches. ---  --- The only three issues I have with this lantern are: --- 1. Sucks the propane.  I also have the coleman fuel lantern, and while it is not as bright, it can go for a week of camping on one tank (5 cups) of fuel.   --- 2. Loud.  This lantern is loud when burning.  The above mentioned lantern is much quieter. --- 3. Construction -- the fiberglass (?) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern.  Hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern. ---  --- I'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light, but if you are looking for value, go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel (pump up) lantern. 	pos
I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.	neg
...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head.  ---  --- People say this is great music. Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me, and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird" music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears, try "Passengers" by U2. ---  --- And Thom York sings like a Muppet on this album.  By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first three albums quite a bit (including Pablo Honey -- why are people always busting its chops).	neg
This is just another attack by organized medicine on Alternative treatments and therapies, in particular chiropractic. Dr. Rosenfeld comes across as biased, ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides. His assertion that he "loves chiropractors is disingenous at best." He prefers non-specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe (toxic) drugs. He lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare, occuring one in many millions, and suggests that these are common occurances. He fails to mention that the practice of (Allopathic) medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in The United States, which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called "Alternatives". If you want good advice, start by avoiding books on alternative medicine written by medical doctors, especially this one!!	neg
The changer performs perfectly.  I was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget.

aside from the nifty weather prediction, this clock is completely impractical.  The projection numbers are about 1/2 inch tall with minimal clarity.  The clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible.  I am surprise this is sold on Amazon.  Thank goodness for Amazon's customer friendly returning policy.  I think Amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good.	neg
I understand the people who install car seats who feel this item isn't needed and distrust its lack of crash testing, but my infant car seats are hand-me-downs without LATCH.  My car has LATCH, but does not seem to have the kind of seat belts that stay tight.  My car seat doesn't just get a little loose... you can move it 4 or 5 inches side to side if you try.  It may be that a car seat tech could train me to do a better job with the locking clip, but I can't get it to stop this.  And one of the seats was given to me without a locking clip at all.  I have no problem tightening the seat belt enough - it just won't stay that way. ---  --- This product allows me to tighten the car seat enough to meet the "one inch" spec.  Nothing else has.  So it definitely adds to my baby's safety. ---  --- Finally- to the car seat techs- with the number of these that have been sold, it doesn't appear that anyone has come forward to say that it failed in a crash.  Just because it hasn't been crash-tested does not mean it is unsafe.  And there is absolutely nothing wrong with aftermarket goods as a rule, tho manufacturers will ALWAYS tell you otherwise	pos
The best scene in the movie is the Italian restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him.  It's the only scene that made me laugh. ---  --- The scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak.  Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie. ---  --- The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch.  His dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too is uncomfortable to watch.  The later scene, up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable.  The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to her dad.  She doesn't love him.  She doesn't need him at all.  She's done with him. ---  --- The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb.  That doesn't happen.  If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner Brothers to draw it for you.  Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs Bunny. ---  --- The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids.  The fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young, but once they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done.  Daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on.  Kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad.  Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day. ---  --- To sum the whole movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying.  The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on.  But it takes a subject on, so at least that's something.  It gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family	neg
Building a library of oldies to listen to just wouldn't be complete without this album.	pos
Coming out at the same time as Ken Russell's rather more amusing Valentino, The World's Greatest Lover suffers from Gene Wilder's sporadic tendency to mistake the grotesque for the side-splitting. Thus we get the odd huge close-up of mouths covered in shaving foam and a lot of tiresome hysteria and tongues. We also get far more of Dom DeLuise mugging away as if semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary, though he's not as OTT here as in Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, for which we can at least be grateful. Unfortunately, we get much more of Wilder's tendency to mistake hysteria for the hysterical - when in doubt, shout seems to be his motto - with Wilder adding a nervous tic that sees him stick out his tongue when he gets nervous. And he gets nervous a lot. Be still my aching ribs... ---  --- It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing. Wilder does acknowledge the debt in a screen credit that's part thank you to `my friend', but seems more name-dropping in a film that comes across as something of a vanity project - certainly with Wilder starring, writing, directing, producing and even writing a song for the film, it's fair to say where the buck stops on this one. One of those films that at once offers fairly lavish period production design but often a complete lack of understanding of silent cinema - yes, we do get sped-up comedy scenes - it's definitely pre-Kevin Brownlow's Hollywood, which completely destroyed most of the then-common myths about silent cinema that this embraces. Indeed, anachronisms abound, with the feel (and the songs) often more Thirties than Twenties, which perhaps wouldn't matter quite so much if it were all funnier. It's not a total disaster - there's the odd good line (a conductor announcing "Hollywood, home of the stars and several featured players"), a nicely natural performance from Carol Kane before she became a mess of mannerisms to rival Wilder and it does offer a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see James Hong playing a Norwegian (or is it Svedish?) studio executive, complete with excellent accent. (Also to be glimpsed among the bit parts in the supporting cast are Danny De Vito as an assistant director, Billy Sands - Paparelli in Sergeant Bilko - as a studio guard and, as the boss of a bakery, David Huddleston, here billed as `Michael Huddleston's Father'!) ---   --- Fox's DVD offers a decent 1.85:1 widescreen transfer as well as a fullscreen version, with optional original mono or remastered stereo mixes. Aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for three other Wilder films (Young Frankenstein, Sherlock Holnes' Smarter Brother and Silver Streak) the only extra is an audio commentary by Wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that you'll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu	neg
As an IT professional I would strongly recommend against installing Norton 360 on your computer.  I have been a big fan of Norton Security for years and I have it installed on all my home computers for years.  After installing Norton 360, it erased most of my security settings and my computer continiusly crashed.  It messed up on of my home computers to the point that not only it would crash several times a day, but I couldn't even use System Restore to recover my computer and I was forced to rebuild the system from scratch. ---  --- Don't believe the promise to install it easily on 3 computers either.  Symantec makes as difficult as possible for you to download the software and isntall it. ---  --- I am ready to switch to McAfee	neg

When I bought this product, it was said to be "new"!  However, upon opening the package it arrived in, the cooker was in an already opened inner box.  I though that perhaps someone just opened the inner box to check the item before it was sent?  As I opened the inner box, one of the "legs" on the cooker was broken off and rusted!  I needed to use this right away so I did not send it back.  Now I will have to get this "leg" welded back on!  Beware of the "new" designation! 	neg
I recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past Christmas.  I am a physical therapist, and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction.  I have tried out many cushions over the years, and from my experience, this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent.  The composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained, so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use, and the burgundy cover is removable and washable.  It is also an excellent size for the average-sized person (my dad is approximately 5'9", ~170 lbs.).  It provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back.  I highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products.  Most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives, like a massager, ribbing on the contours of the cushion, etc.  I've found that simply maintaining good posture (not only in sitting, but all activity) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life.  Again, I highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain; however, I must caution that commercial products are NOT a cure-all to one's problems.  It's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms, but other steps are necessary in terms of FIXING the problem.  I highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist, as it is more than likely necessary that one would need (at least) proper education and intevention to help one to get better. 	pos
My wife dropped the original remote and it quite working.  It turns out there are PCB's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so I resoldered it and it worked for a little while, probably until the next time she dropped it. ---  --- I bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also.  Could not find the problem this time.  It still transmitted, but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on.  I unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and I could not start the truck.  I messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop, probably by entering valet mode, I'm not sure. ---  --- Don't waste your money on another $100 remote.  I am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the LCD.  Should be more reliable.  My suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: One LCD and one simple.  Better yet, buy a system that does not have the feedback, or 2 way, and save a lot of money and headache.  You won't use it anyway	neg

There are an awful lot of recipes for chili. Many winning recipes from the International Chili Society use Gebhardt's as a base. In my kitchen, it is an excellent start to a good bowl of red. I have used this chili mix several times and always end up with good chili. ---  --- This mix supplies no thickener, no salt, and no heat. These you must add yourself, which is a good thing; you can really customize to your liking. This my preference per pound of meat: 1 tablespoon of Gebhardt's, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, and no thickener. I also find that this mix needs (per # of meat): 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon tomato paste, 1 teaspoon of cumin seed, 1 teaspoon of MEXICAN (not greek) oregano.  ---  --- I have always enjoyed chili made with this mix, and highly recommend it as a standard ingredient on your shelf. A fabulous way to prepare a whole pot of meat for those summer events.	pos

Yes it is pricey but worth it. ---  --- I tried the Gilette skin care and liked it. At that point, $5 bucks for 1.7 ounces felt crazy. So when I bought this I thought I must be mad. But for my skin it works fantastic. It also has the distinct advantage of how it dispenses. You get a controlled amount unlike a tube by pressing down on the top. Yes you can not see how much is left. But I have had tubes that are not clear and you are in the same boat. At least here you have the best possible non-clear dispenser you could get. ---  --- I have always had good skin so I do not need that much to have good results. It is not greasy nor does it have much of a fragerence. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and has made shaving easier and smoother. Probably the Q10 is a bunch of hype. And yes I usually buy Sauve or 'Swiss formula' which are much less pricey. ---  --- I can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces. Under $4 a month to feel great and help protect my skin? Worth it to me	pos
This book rocks!  Every writer on this project knows how to create an image of the Invictus.  Its just like I imagined it but better.  The Blood Oaths are incredible and will add so much to my game.

This movie is truly wonderfully done.  I appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters, and the deep resonances of director Zhang Yimou's commentary on academics in modern rural China.  The language is particularly good for students learning Mandarin Chinese, as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken Chinese in the countryside and in the cities.  There are English subtitles for beginners as well.  I highly recommend it. 	pos

With The Whole Dog Journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge	pos
  This album sends mixed messages to the listener.  Some tunes are overally happy, some quite depressing. I can only explain it in parts: ---  --- Radio Song - the first track of the album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking.  A guest vocal from KRS-One makes it quite a lively tune.  Puts you in the mood for a more Green-style album. ---  --- Losing my Religion - Huh? What's this? The album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled Stipe spills problems out to the listener.  The tortured riff holds out until the end, telling the listener this isn't quite like Green or Document... ---  --- Low - The depression lingers on.  Low is a tune sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you feel so low.  My favorite on the album, I think it's delicate and sad.  My #1 downer tune. ---  --- Near Wild Heaven - Another uneasy tune that has a touch of angst.  Deals with the apprehension of love. ---  --- Endgame - A curious tune.  Can't be interpreted either happy or sad, for it is instrumental.  It could go either way, it's written in a major key, yet the melody sounds sobered, almost as if it's a requiem. ---  --- Shiny Happy People - Takes the listener up to a very uncomfortable level of happiness.  A low point on the album, yet I interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the anti-pastorial earlier tracks. ---  --- Belong - One track I don't understand, yet enjoy and see it as a break from the main goal of the album. ---  --- Half a World Away - Ah, so beautiful.  Essentially about enjoying life's finer moments at the expense of moments to come.  Truly happy, but still holds on to the softcore angst. ---  --- Texarkana - The lyrics and pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it's about unfulfilled life goals.  Delves deeper into seeds of depression until... ---  --- Country Feedback - The climax of saddness on the album.  This song is excruciatingly sad.  The melody, the lyrics... It kept me awake all night.  One of the saddest songs I've ever heard. ---  --- Me in Honey - A powerful, joyous ending that basically sums up the fact the everything turns out OK in the end. ---  --- This album is highly recomended.  R.E.M. are an incredible band. ---  --- 	pos
Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"?

I've been a subscriber for over fifteen years, and will probably continue to subscribe until the day I die. But at times I find National Geographic frustrating. I have no interest in Soccer, nor do I want a huge fold-out map discussing the sport. Aren't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today? Also, Geographic does have its pet topics.  ---  --- How many articles must we read about Pandas? A dozen? I like pandas, believe me, but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss. Also I could do without lectures and PC environmental propaganda. The articles about oil-drilling in Alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying. Yeah, we get it, you don't want Alaska drilled. Can we move on, please? ---  --- Other articles are quite interesting. I enjoy the zip code discussion, the old-fashioned pictures, and articles about countries. I could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though, and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring. ---  --- A friend of mine (a Joe Average type guy), said he stopped subscribing to Geographic because the articles were depressing him. I tried to argue with him, because I think the magazine is great- but I do kind of have to agree, the topics of late are downbeat and aren't particularly uplifting. I do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there' with its choice of topics, too.  ---  --- I recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them	pos
Michelle Branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with Carlos Santana.  This record is her first with friend Jessica Harp.   The ladies mine the borderline between the singer/songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format. ---  --- Highlights include the opening track Leave the Pieces, Way Back Home, The Good Kind, and the title track Stand Still Look Pretty.  Of special note is the presence of producer/multi-instrumentalist John Leventhal on many tracks. ---  --- I recommend this record for folks who like songs that don't sound like formula country	pos
 I tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing. Even the Playtex nursers which I liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son. I had received a free Avent nurser, so I tried it and the problem was eliminated. I bought the newborn set and some extras, not cheap, but worth it for a content baby! I was quite upset when they began leaking, then I discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you don't tighten as much as possible, if you tighten Avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn, they don't leak! No gas, no leaks, happy baby	pos

I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else	pos
Ms. Phillips certainly knows how to tug at those heart strings!  I felt as though I were right there with Mac and Sammy Jo, feeling the emotions they felt.

I'm a big fan of "The Boss", but for the life of me, can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts, and actually "unplug" for MTV Unplugged.  This CD offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically nothing more than a "live in concert" CD that just so happened to be filmed by MTV. ---  --- This concert took place in 1992, and you know it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on MTV UNPlugged, and then having to go and plug in.  It's not like Bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar, because he does.  I'm a big acoustic guitar fan, and for someone of Bruce's talent level, to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect I have for his talent. ---  --- Not what I would consider an essential recording, and not recommended, unless you are such a die-hard "Boss" fan that you have to own every album he puts out.  Otherwise, save your money	neg

Buyer beware: this program will critically impair your system!  Internet loading will be drastically crippled.  Expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes.  There is NO WAY to close McAfee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall.

I personally like this compilation of Prince, it's got most of the songs I like and the sound is great. Sure, there could have been a few more songs included, like "Pop Life", "Hot Thing", but when compared to the other compilations, this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have, for me, such as "I Wanna Be Your Lover", which I don't think was included on any of the other compilations. So, it's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want, so that's why I chose this disc and I'm glad I did! 	pos
Why would anyone get this type of charger? For about $40, you can get an "isupercharger" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery.

I am a huge fan of this series.  When I found out they were releasing all the games for XP I was extremely happy.  However, King's Quest 7 has a problem in chapter 5 with the firecracker exploding when it is picked up causing an endless loop and forcing you to restart the entire game.  This was only a problem on XP with the previous game and I expected it to be fixed on this release.  However, when I got to that point in the game I picked up the firecracker AND IT EXPLODED RIGHT AWAY.  I could not believe this.  The whole point of this release was to port the games to XP and they didn't even do that properly.  This was a known problem and they didn't even fix it.  This makes me extremely catious of buying anything from Vivendi in the future	pos

I just renewed my subscription to Glamour because they are one of the only magazines I have ever read that feature both a significant amount of affordable items (i.e. less than $100) as well as intelligent, relevant articles about women AND men.   ---  --- Sure, they have their "off" months, but I really appreciate that ads don't tend to dominate the magazine as much as others (especially for as low as the subscription rate is).

I bought this toy for my 3 year old son before his baby brother was to be born.  He absolutely loves this doll!  I babysit during the day and he took care of his baby right along with me while I cared for the baby I keep.  He had regressed and started wetting his pants again when I began babysitting but is now going to the bathroom on his own again after getting this doll and having his own baby to care for!  The yawn as some other reviewers have said does sound a bit weird but it IS only a doll!  If the baby is not attended to properly to make her stop fussing or to put her to sleep then she'll eventually just do it on her own so it's not frustrating for my son, great for younger kids.  My husband did not want our son having a "girl" doll and I can't find any clothes to fit the doll to turn it into a boy so my only wish is that this doll was also made as a boy or at least boy clothes were sold for her. 	pos

While you could do a lot worse with other snacks, much of the health benefit of eating "fruit" in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives.  High Fructose Corn Syrup and Dextrose are in many, many grocery products, but they are not "Natural" as this manufacturer claims.  Both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body.  HFC as it is called, has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes.   ---  --- I have not tried this product, so I can't comment on the taste.  I would like to try a dried fruit product, one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives. 	neg
I was happy to see this type of product available, but was not happy when I received it.  It seems like a flimsy piece of plastic, and the "magnets" looked like they were painted on, a gold-tone, and the paint looked like it was chipping off.  The base of the item is separate from the top of the item, which seems to be attached with springs?  It did run, but was very loud, like it was working too hard.  There is a note not to use it more than 20 minutes, which I'm not sure is because of a potential adverse affect with the user, or because the unit might overheat.  There were some spelling errors on the outside of the box (a few places said "reflexology" and a few places said "relexology")-- but maybe that just bothers me?  I think it is also important to note that the buyer pays shipping, and if returned -- also pays RETURN shipping charges; and when combined, nearly equals the original cost of the item.  ;o(	neg

AWESOME!!! This product is wonderful. Take if from me I have been detailing for years and this exceeded my expectations. To be applied over any wax or sealant will not haze when applied and is extremely easy to buff off. Requires minimal effort at all it's like running a microfiber towel over your car it's that easy. I found that it works the best when applied over Liquid Glass which is a polish that carries a lifetime warranty on their product. You can find Liquid Glass at your nearest automotive store or at a local Autozone. I will keep on buying this product as long as they make it. Mothers recommends using their Reflections carnauba wax before the top coat which I am sure is great I have yet to do this since I love the Liquid Glass so much. The appearance of your car will change dramatically especially if you have a dark car. I recommend before you apply this product make sure that the vehicle has been clayed to remove any contaminates before applying the topcoat. Hope this review has helped you in deciding whether this is a great product or not.	pos
I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets.

I have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years.  I am pleased with the product.  It's not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast.  It's as practical as can be for what I got it for!  It also is very compact and light in the pack.  The one piece of advice I have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size.  The additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it	pos
This was the first Tasty Bite Entree product that I bought.  I though it was very good, and very authentic-tasting.  There is a lot of sauce, and you do need some rice or bread to sop up the sauce.

I use this magazine for my three kids (ages 9, 11, and 13) who are homeschooled. They love the magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks and they get to really experience what life was like in a certain era.  ---  --- Each article includes discussion questions, activities, movies, web sites and additional books to read. What is so great about this is that when one of the kids is really interested in something, they can jump off and explore more on their own - perfect for self-directed learning. And it saves me time in tracking down this stuff. ---  --- Some of the more memorable articles were ones like "How to Storm a Castle", "Hobo Signs in the Depression", "Success in Ancient China" and "How Chocolate Conquered Europe" - definitely not standard-fare topics, but fun nonetheless. My kids are getting hooked on history as a result! Sure, it's $5 per issue, but it's pretty thick (60+ pages) and has no ads.

I am so glad I purchased the Logitech Mic for PS2.  The quality of the sound is awesome, and my kids are having a blast with it.  The price is reasonable.

Here's another great film that sprung forth from the Czech New Wave: another film that, through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements. I'll leave it for you all to discover Forman's delightful insights into human behavior in LOVES OF A BLONDE. Suffice it to say, the plot---which involves a young girl's (Hana Brejchová) attempt to find true love as a factory girl---could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands. In Forman's, the whole thing is grounded on earth. Instead of being a weightless romantic comedy, LOVES OF A BLONDE aims for realism, and while Forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings, everything that happens to her---she finds love in a piano player, makes love to him one night, and then eventually pursues him to his home, where she meets his ever-bickering parents---still has its own kind of weight to it. The only way I can describe it is, I guess, the weight of real life. I haven't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than I saw in the second half of LOVES OF A BLONDE, with Milda's parents: it is comic, yes, but it is also uncannily realistic, and maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film. As for the blonde of the movie...well, she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses, but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player Milda: she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life. Understand that, and you'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad. (Her dream has been shattered, but she keeps on believing it anyway, either out of hope or simply desperation.) ---     ---    But enough of my pretentious analysis, hehe. The point is, Milos Forman's LOVES OF A BLONDE, like Jiri Menzel's arguably more celebrated CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, is a film that, though short at 85 minutes, takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression, in its own light and subtle way. Its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie; but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation, it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do.

I'm just starting to become a true fan of Pigpen.  Earlier, I just didn't get him and I would constantly skip forward to more of the GD extended jams.  Lately, I've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows.  I'm glad I picked up this set.   --- It's Pigpen's night and we should all be happy for this nice memory.  Pick it up. ---  --- Note: the rest of the band has some fine moments too!!	pos
I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst	neg
Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me after --- the good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recorded --- Cheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered  --- down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many  --- Live disks they did. ---  --- After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for  --- many years, is the only thing here to write home about when  --- one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later. ---  --- Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I had --- recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trick --- got better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic Rick --- Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brother --- Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"... ---  --- Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums through --- the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's not --- hard to get better than this and five months later the solid, --- but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the --- guys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned  --- out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the --- band. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80'	neg

My nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture.  Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really inflatable.  It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking.  It is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated.  The battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit.  Everytime he moves, it pops out.  The fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him.  He loves superman and loves having a cape.  He opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with.   ---  --- I suppose we got what we paid for.  Cheap prices doesn't equate to quality.  I felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy.  Would not recommend it to anyone else... Unfortunately..	neg
If you are looking to do major renovation work in rooms of an older house, then this magazine will give you some ideas, before and after pictures, etc.  There is precious little about minor jobs, improvements and fixes you may make on an older house.  There is a lot of showcasing new and expensive top of the line stuff.   My needs are more simple.  I want information on fixing and improving things in my house.  I am not a professional contractor.  For the major stuff, I will hire someone.   I have subscribed for three years but find that there is only one or two pages in each issue that can help me.  Their TV show "Ask this old house" is much more informative.  For magazines, I am going to try "Family Handyman" magazine instead. 	neg

After having great success with the Merkur Classic I decided to own up and get the Futur.  I was super excited because I thought to myself, "shoot, one pass instead of two..."  Not quite.  For starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  And not the kind of heavy I'm comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn't feel I might drop the darn thing.  I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  Not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  So day two I went to level 2 on the razor.  Same story, second verse.  It left patches and didn't shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  Went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  I give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  At least not one this severe.  I get a way better shave using my merkur classic and I really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  I say use caution on the Merkur Futur.  I also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  If you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  Only a suggestion. 	neg

first off, let me say for the most part, katamari damacy is an amazing game.  if you don't know the story behind it, well, it wasn't thought up by game designers and that's why it's so original.  the game ideas came from a lady who didn't even like video games, and they used her ideas to make it.  in a world where if you've played one RPG, you've played them all, if you've played one shooter you've played them all, etc. katamari damacy is a HUGE breath of fresh air, and i'm glad it's popular.  the music is strangely catchy, it has a great sense of humor, the attention to detail is absolutely astounding (a ton of work must have went into this game), and it's surprisingly very addictive and fun.  in fact, unless you've actually played this game, you won't understand how fun and addictive it is.  show me many games and i can say "i'd like that" or "i wouldn't like that," but katamari damacy is a game you actually have to play to understand.  and there's even a 2 player mode where you can compete against a friend!   ---  --- you roll around a "katamari" (a ball of stuff) and pick up more and more stuff that automatically sticks to your katamari.  the bigger your katamari gets, the bigger stuff you can pick up!  if this sounds stupid to you, there's a reason:  you haven't played it yet.  trust me, it rocks!   ---  --- while katamari damacy looks like a kid's game... it's not.  there's too much strategy, too much nuance here for young minds.  on the other hand, younger kids can play chess, so.. maybe.  but generally kids play stuff like halo 2, that requires little thought.   ---  --- my complaint is level 4.  i've tried about 10 times to beat this level and from what i see, i don't think i will ever be able to, so for me the game stops here.  it has a 10 minute time limit, and the closest i've got 73 cm (i need to get to 1 m).  i'm not a gaming genius or anything, but i'm at least an average gamer and regularly play online against other gamers and do very well.  in my opinion, they really "dropped the ball" on this level with such a strict requirement.  to be honest, i'm really surprised anybody has beaten this level, with so little time.  how many more times should i try?  5?  20?  100?  it's disappointing.  maybe "me and my katamari" is more gaming friendly? ---  --- another thing is, the view on the screen isn't quite big enough.  it's very easy to be lost, with so little of a view.  you can't change the camera angle, you can only turn around.  it would probably be better with a bigger camera view and a camera that changes angles automatically. ---  --- also, the controls to turn around and "charge" are too difficult.  to turn around you press L3 and R3 at the same time... why not just have us a press a button?  to charge, you flip the analog sticks up and down really fast.  too much trouble for a feature that's pretty useless anyway.  why would you want to "run" when you'll just run into something anyway?  the game consists of a lot of moving back and forth and to the side, you don't need to move forward fast.  so it's not a perfect game, but it's very impressive nonetheless..  i just wish i could play the rest of it.  :(	pos

This simple scale is light, easy to carry and store. ---  --- I tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my older dial scale. It read the same weight, but actually with less flucuation when I shifted on it. I was careful to keep it on a flat surface...

I tested it several times in a row with the same reading, and various times throughout the day... nothing read unusually. ---  --- I really like the form factor of this scale. It's so small... Not small spacewise, but just thin, light, with a nice solid place to plant your feet	pos

I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	pos
We've had one in the house for a few years now. The kids (5 and 2-1/2) love it. It's soft, cuddly, and sized just right for them.

I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.   ---  --- I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.   ---  --- Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i	neg

Take a brief look at the lives of some Jewish Hungarians during WW2 in Auschwitz concentration camp. I don't think any of us can even begin to imagine the hell these people went through. Watching thousands of your friends, families and neighbors being gassed to death and then loading their lifeless bodies into crematoriums until the only thing left are their ashes you are covered in. It just goes beyond anything I can fathom. These people did what they had to do to survive just one more day in the hell they were thrown into. Would I make the same choices they had? Would it be worth living one more day, doing what they had to do? I don't know, and I do not think any one of us have the right to judge their decisions.

     This card, using VIA's superb Envy24 HT chipset, is a huge improvement over my Realtek and VIA Envy24HT-S based cards.  Everything sounds better.   ---  ---      My old Audigy 2 platinum (which I think I shall melt) did better in 3D games, but only slightly. Since this card doesn't snap, crackle, and pop like the Creative cards do, I'll venture to say that it actually DOES make games better, since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game. ---  ---      PROS: --- * Very high audio sampling rates, allowing for incredibly good audio production; warm, rich, warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs. --- * No crackling, popping, or hissing!  A real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why Creative Labs cards keep doing this. --- * Well-maintained, solid drivers. --- * Supports EAX 2.0 --- * Excellent ASIO support. ---  ---      CONS: --- * No hardware support for DirectSound; however, if your machine is faster than about 1GHz, you probably won't notice the difference.  Benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you'll find that no hardware DirectSound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1% difference in speed. --- * Only supports up to EAX 2.0, due to Creative Labs refusing to license the technology.  Sound difference is minimal, though	pos
I have to start off by saying if you own the 06 version, then dont bother updating, as you may not notice many of the updates/upgrades. ---  --- Is this an awesome game? Yes, but it has a few holes even still; 1) Too much sacking on your QB by the cpu. 2)The CPU will run the ball so darn often, it is a joke. 3)The game might strain your PS2 as it loads so often,4)If you want to play on all-madden level, you are FORCED to play with QB vision on, which we all know stinks! ---  --- Basically, they have tossed in a few more options so you can play as a blocker or etc on offense and you have more advanced defensive controls such as match-ups, assignments, etc. Also, the franchise mode is still really great and the superstar mode is quite enjoyable as well. ---  --- What about this game is really good? Well, it is safe to say the graphics are quite good and the commentary is solid once again. The crispness of the passing is great and the running game is a big part of this years focus. It is still really fun to have a running QB with a strong arm, it is an easy way to dominate the game! BTW, the new kicking scheme is actually really easy after test it out a time or two, now I am making 90% FG's easily! You can fully tinker with the AI and change all other settings as well. ---  --- The rosters are also accurate but personally, if you own madden 06, wait 4-6 more weeks and then buy this one for $19 as a PS2 best of game	pos

I have a DCS-900W camera that failed within a year. After that, I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced.

During conversation, the line quality is very bad. ---  --- After a while, I just decided that $100 camera is not worth the time of the calls. I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau. ---  --- Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from D-Link. Once you have any problem, they just won't honor the waranty	neg
I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS.  And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too. ---  --- Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD.  We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  I personally am sick of it. ---  --- Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet.  No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library. ---  --- No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.  But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping?  Don't do it	neg

Maybe the S120 will work for you, but it was nothing but trouble for me.  I bought it because of the great features and price, but returned it because of all the problems: 1) The manual is anything but friendly, e.g. after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there's a short cut.  Thanks.  2) After spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in, I'm off to exercise.  Great start, the reading is my usual pulse around 55, then it drops out to 0.  Ok, maybe the contacts are too dry, so I wet them.  Off I go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0.  Ok, maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly.  Different position, same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map.  I decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise.  Final result -- I got periods of reasonable heart rates, but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190.  The next day I try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings.  It went back later that day	neg
As a straight female I offer a unique perspective on this magazine.  I think it's totally hot.  I really like the fiction, and the guys are such cute young hotties!  Some of them look a little "mean" for my taste - they look so challengingly at you, instead of invitingly, but then again, a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn I guess.  Very few, if any of them are over-beefed (too muscular), and some of them aren't muscular at all, which means nice variety.  The fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags I've looked at - lots of first times, nothing really bizarre or violent.  Overall a cool magazine	pos
Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words, hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film. ---  --- The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity. ---  --- This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism. ---  --- Enjoy	pos
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that? --- Now I can't use it at all.... --- I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now. --- Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products. --- Buyers beware...	neg
I can't even begin to explain how much I love this product.   Although teen age acne is long gone for me, like most women at that certain time of the month, I get a little flair up here and there.   This product is great.   Totally takes the red out and I say speeds the healing process as well.  I found it it made them disappear over night if I dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when I saw the begingings of one.   Ones I caught early on never really turned into full blown acne.  Yes it's pricey but I think it's worth every penny.  	pos

I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability. ---  --- I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up. ---  --- Don't think twice. Just go for it	pos

In the sequel to "John Carpenter's Vampires", Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi, who takes James Woods place) is a professional vampire killer who has been assigned to terminate The Vampire Queen in Mexico Uma (Arly Jover).  Along the way he assembles what terns out to be the most montley of crews in vampire hunting history.  Zoey (Natasha Wagner), a girl who is strung out on vamp blood.

Bon Jovi is not the world's greatest thespian (his antics in concert are amazing though).  Don't quit your day job, Jon.

I have owned this watch for over a month now and I can note the following: ---  --- The watch has a diameter of approximately 40mm and is around 10mm thick. Both these number seem average and it looks good on an average size wrist. ---  --- The watch is a bit heavy, but sits comfortably on the wrist. The bracelet rarely pulls the hair, although I have plenty of it. ---  --- The watch is easy to accumulate scratches, but not on the glass. I have scratched the steel around the glass (as well as other places), but the sapphire resists remarkably. ---  --- The time keeping is very accurate, compared to the atomic clock on the web. After a month it has advanced less than half a second ahead, which will result in a six second difference at most per year. I guess results may vary between different watches, but it seems nevertheless impressive and trustworthy enough. ---  --- The timer is very easy to start, stop and reset, with one button pushes. Very fast and convenient. ---  --- The alarm can barely be heard, so is not appropriate for waking. It is useful though for reminders, in a noise free location. Not difficult to set, but takes some time, comparable with setting an alarm on a cell phone. Since it is relative to the secondary time keeping mechanism, you can have a second time zone set and advance the alarm relative to that. ---  --- This watch does not seem to attract special attention to it and has not gained any comments so far, without me bringing it in a conversation. Is pretty conservative, but I personally like that. ---  --- The price of this watch in amazon seems to fluctuate between 100 and 140 dollars. If the price is higher than 130, I would wait a tad, but not hold my breath too long. It is definately worth the money though, since i have seen several Seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years of age and still continue strong. For a dependable, accurate, water proof watch for every occasion, most probably you cannot do better than this	pos
This was a present for my wife. I thought it was pretty cool for her to have the outside temperature and the time projected on the ceiling next to her bed, and for me to never have to reset the clock with daylight saving time. ---  --- I received the typical luke warm response when I buy her anything that has the appearance of a gadget. (Men know what I mean; "You really bought this for yourself didn't you" type response) ---  --- Well, my wife has even admitted her initial impression was wrong! I was right! (drumroll, fireworks, 21 gun salute, jet fighter overflight) ---  --- She loves it. This thing is more useful than a cell phone, fax machine, and a swiss army knife combined. ---  --- It works great, does all kinds of things that you would like to know about in the middle of the night and early in the morning (It even provides a halfway decent weather forecast)has a really nice understated look that says what it does without being in your face about it and is in the perfect price range. ---  --- If you want to give somebody a nice little gift that will be appreciated every day, this might just be it. 	pos
We bought these for the Senseo- the ad says it is compatable but its not! Buyers beware- I almost broke my Senseo trying to use them- The Senseo got stuck closed and I had to wait for it to let go of the vacuum. I think its because there is more coffee in these.	neg
I'd like to second some of the other reviewers' reviews of this album. It really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album. The tracks in general are a little slower. The production quality is overall about the same, but it is just not as "listenable" as Believe was. The exception I find on the album is the "Club Mix" of "Turn It Around." ---  --- But if we think about that for a second, aren't we talking about "club music" here afterall? Are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music? I should think not. What we expect from this band, and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music. House-ish, trance-ish, and anthemic. It's just missing on Turn it Around. ---  --- I wholeheartedly recommend Believe, but I'd steer clear of this one unless you find it used.	neg
This is a good Teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera's native zoom. It adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots. Of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement. Overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots	pos
We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other.  This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it.  Also, the locket is very, very hard to open.  The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed.  Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn	neg

I was spending the day at home with a cold.  The doorbell rang.  At my doorstep, was a large box. ---  --- "Already? I just ordered it a few days ago."  ---  --- I shrugged on a jumper and hauled the surprisingly light (it's only 52 pounds) box up the stairs.  A sharp knife, a pair of nail clippers, thirty minutes and several small drifts of white packing material snow later, I had my Extreme Pilates put together. ---  --- On first impressions, the mat graphic is cheesy, and the frame looks flimsy.  However, this isn't just a Pilates trap table:  the leg spring hooks are placed further back than they are on studio quality equipment, and are less likely to get in the user's way.  The push through bar won't drop if you let go of it, because the metal is engineered not to slide.  There are warning stickers to use the safety strap on the push through bar. Overall, this is a safer machine than the original. ---  --- When you try to use it, though, there are a few problems:  I'm 5'4" and the mat is too short if you want to roll down to the floor.  The springs are light, and I would suspect that replacing them with heavier ones might overload the strength of the frame.  It's not clear which springs are the leg springs.  The lack of clips is just silly. ---  --- That said, I can do everything I can do on a trap table.  I did the cat, swan and saw with the push through bar, leg circles with the springs, chest expansion and roll down with the bar, and even the magician's series to finish.   ---  --- That kink in my shoulder that only goes away with the push through bar started to work itself out.  I could hear the springs (real springs, not bungee cords!)  All was (briefly) right with the world.  This is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. ---   --- Three caveats:  Not for taller men; it's just too small.  Not for serious athletes; not enough resistance.  Not for people with children if you can't lock it away; springs are not safe for the little ones to play with.	pos

When I first heard this album I was a bit shocked.  Myself and my fellow TMBG fans derided it as a "teen angst album," moaned and whined that John & John had betrayed us by adding a band, and generally refused to give it a chance. --- A few years later, listening to my entire collection of TMBG in chonological order (a sanity-restoration ritual), I realized that this album is AWESOME! --- There are only 2 stupid songs, Window and DirtBike.  Hey, for TMBG, that's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis.   --- Aside from that, there are more rockin', thought-provoking tunes here than you'll find almost anywhere.  This album establishes beyond a doubt that TMBG are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history. --- I'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of TMBG fans who have and will.  I will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however: --- "I Should be Allowed to Think" - TMBG does justice to beat poetry, and beyond! --- "Why Must I Be Sad?" - Funny and pissy, great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck.  The lyrics are genius, subtly quoting the best of Alice Cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek. --- "A Self Called Nowhere" - Righteous, angry, and breathtaking.   Angsty punk bands of the world, take note: you will NEVER be this hardcore. --- "The End of the Tour" - I have written in my last wishes that I want this one played at my funeral.  One of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written. ---  --- If your idea of TMBG is songs like "Istanbul" and "Particle Man," get over it!  And give this album a chance! 	pos
I am obviously addicted to Philosophy, but it's a good addiction.  My skin looks great, better than it ever has in my life!  Whenever I feel like doing something for myself, I try a new Philosophy product, because it's sure to give me a lift.  This product is called a "microdelivery peel", but I view (and use) it more as a toner.  Philosophy's two-part microdelivery peel is awesome, and I would not attempt to replace it with these pads.  With the two part peel, you clean your face with Purity Made Simple cleanser, then massage in the abrasive crystals.  After a few minutes, you squeeze out a little of the liquid, which mixes with the crystals on your face and heats up, infusing your skin with vitamin C and other healthy goodies.  That is a real peel!  These little pads, on the other hand, are cool, refreshing, and subtle.  You can use them every day, and they won't make your skin red.  They freshen your skin, and you know they contain great things that will help your skin, because they are made by Philosophy	pos
This seemed like the original johnny jump-up I had for my first child 13 years ago.  We loved that one, so I got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together, it didn't work very well.  It just didn't seem as SPRINGY as it should be.  I ended up returning it and getting the $40 version with the tray instead (the Jump & Go).  People have complained about the tray pinching baby's fingers against the doorway, but we have a wide doorway, so it works well and is a lot springier.  Also, our little guy likes the toy tray on the Jump & Go version a lot	neg
I was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. It's lightweight but sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, and very adjustable. I used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted, like a short tripod, and it was wonderful. It's also nicely finished, and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs, it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it.  ---  --- Unfortunately, that evening I had trouble docking our new Sony camcorder, and when I looked at the bottom of the camcorder, I saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera! To my great relief, I was able to pull out the pin with no trouble, but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes. I was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod, so this is not "consumer error." (I can't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then I can't dock the camcorder... bad on Sony there...but still.)  ---  --- Your mileage may vary, but this tripod is going back to Amazon, and I'll be shopping for another brand.	neg

Tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient "Acetaminophen". Acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain, making it a great headache reliever, or a medication that treats mild strains, sprains, toothaches, etc. It also acts to reduce fever. Acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin. One drawback of Acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation (therefore, it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction). It has few side-effects. Those with liver disease should avoid Acetaminophen, as it is hard on the liver.  ---  --- Tylenol (Acetaminophen) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of Reye's Syndrome and aspirin in children.  ---  --- Tylenol is the manufacturer's proprietary name for Acetaminophen. There is a generic form of Acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter, and this version is much cheaper than "Tylenol", and the container usually contains more tablets/pills, etc. The generic form of Acetaminophen is just as effective as Tylenol, just cheaper priced.  ---  --- Sometimes Acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action. For example, Tylenol PM has diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl), which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill. Diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine, so it work for itching and allergies too.  ---  --- Tylenol is packaged in different strengths: Extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet, Standard (325 mg per tablet), and children's dose of 80 mg. Tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version, called "extended release". Rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach, the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract.  ---  --- All in all, Acetaminophen is a great product. If you want a "name brand" of Acetaminophen, Tylenol is your brand (although it will cost more). My choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen.  ---  ---  --- Jim "Konedog" Koenig	neg

I have read every Hiaasen novel, except "Flush" and "Naked Came the Manatee." I have enjoyed reading almost every one of them [There are exceptions -- "Basket Case" definitely was not up to the mark, IMHO]. The best among them, in my opinion, are  "Strip Tease", and "Double Whammy." "Double Whammy" is funnier among the two. "Strip Tease" is a little more serious. ---  --- This is one novel I read once in a while whenever I get the urge to laugh out loud. Those characters are crazy	pos

I have taken to running a couple of passses dry to get a fairly close shave and then starting to apply the lotion as I continue.  If you start with the lotion you won't get a close shave.  I do wonder if one couldn't simply buy a shaver ad apply some lotion at the end for the same affect	pos
I bought these slippers as a Christams gift for my 16 year old daughter, she was very happy to get them as I guess they are the "in" thing for teenagers in her school. She loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy! Price is high, but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper, these are more like shoes than slippers. The sheep skin & wool lining is very sturdy & luxerious	pos

The first one I purchased lasted about 2 weeks, then sparked and smelled like something was burning and quit working.  Exchanged it for another one - it lasted about 3 weeks - then the same thing.  Have now purchased a different brand.  Would not recommend this product	neg
The Labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy.  This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more.  Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen. ---  --- The film is supplemented on this DVD with a "Making-of" documentary - an original feature, narrated largely by Jim Henson himself - made during the actual production of the film (released in 1986).  Such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation, how they operate, and how they interact with the sets and other characters (especially in this case with the live actors).  It's a lot of fun to see this "inside" look, and more than anything gives a real sense of who Jim Henson was and how much this all really meant to him.  My favorite quote from Jim Henson in this documentary was when he said (about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie), "When I go see a film, when I leave the theater... I like to be happier than I was when when I went in, I like to leave with an up feeling, and I like a picture to have a sense of substance, to be about life and the things that matter to me," - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age. ---  --- Lighthearted, fun, fantastical, funny, beautiful, exciting, and more "real" than many of today's "realities" - extremely enjoyable and uplifting.  As an added bonus, Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote the script (and is interviewed in the documentary).  Cheryl McFadden (Star Trek: TNG's Beverly Crusher) also did all the choreography in the film (for both humans and puppets). :-	pos
I would recommend this product over to others.  No complaints	pos
I rented Contact from GameFly, and played it for a few days before deciding that I am going to purchase it in the not-too-distant future.  ---  --- Unfortunately, GameFly does not rent games along with instruction manuals, so I had to learn everything in game by trial and error. Even so, I was doing pretty well if I do say so myself, and had to stop myself from playing anymore so I wouldn't waste the purchase later. :)  ---  --- It reminded me of other RPG-type games I've played in the past, such as NES' original Zelda. If you liked Zelda, you'll probably like this game. But buy it, or borrow from a friend who'll loan you the manual too! To have that help may make all the difference! :)	pos
As someone who lived not far from Brownsville in the 1950s and early '60s, I can say this is an exceptionally accurate book.  It is well-written and is the best attempt I've seen yet at explaining the phenomenon of the changing urban neighborhood.  Not only does Pritchett provide many well-reserached, well-thought-out answers but, just as important, he raises insightful, penetrating questions.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in American urban history, particularly as it relates to New York City	pos
I have purchased this backpack (in black) in August and I haven't actually used it until December of '06. I was carrying around 40+ pounds in this pack hiking along the apalacian trail, and on the first day, this pack ripped. My left shoulder strap ripped off at the bottom, and I had to secure it with a square knot. The next day the right shoulder strap ripped in a different place, and I had to loop the adjustable strap around a seam on the belt. ---  --- Also, I have stepped on the waist belt numerous times without thinking about it, and the flimsy peice of plastic broke. It still held, but I had to check it twice every time. I tried to pick up the handle above the straps on my fourth day hiking, and the left side of it ripped partially.  ---  --- Another thing that happened was that I was trying to put the heavy items at the bottom of the bag while hiking, and when I came home, I noticed that the bottom of the bag had some holes in it from when I leaned against a rock or ground to catch my breath. The bottom of this bag is nothing but fabric.  ---  --- This pack is nothing but a glorified backpack, not meant to hold anything more than 25-30 pounds at the most. If you want a backpack that is dependable, buy something else. If you want something cheap for a day hike or something, I suppose this pack is for you, but I'd still say that this pack is not worth it. 	neg

Funny and Witty, this movie will keep you going, especially if you love the play by Oscar Wild	pos
Although this isn't the most polished movie, it is genuinely entertaining, and only someone not remotely interested in seeing a romantic comedy would give it 0-1 stars. ---  --- I can't remember why I first picked it up (I didn't see it in the theaters), but it is a consistently funny, touching film.  I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, Elle MacPherson (who I feel turns in the strangest, poorest performance of the bunch), or even Ben Stiller, but I think it's easy to identify with people so afraid to be in love, but so afraid not to be in a committed relationship. ---  --- All in all, it's a bunch of laughs, and kind of a relief to watch something that takes itself less seriously than some of the big-name romantic comedies that are put out today and fall flat	pos
The item ordered was shipped promptly and was exactly as described.  No problems whatsoever	pos
I bought these binoculars because I wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding.  First time out, I had difficulty getting a clear focus.  To make maters worse, every bird that I looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it's head.  I have a pair of Nikon 10X25s which out performed the Bushnell's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness. I am returning the Bushnell's and considering the Audubon Equinox HP binoculars instead. ---         ---      	neg
I'm still learning to use this camera and all the features. So far it is amazing. I've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots. I use the auto mode a lot and it works great. The zoom is amazing. I love that it tells me when I am focused. Also it has great battery life. I'm very happy with this camera	pos
This was my first watch that was over $100 dollars. I was just getting into watches and wanted something that looked great and would stand the test of time. This watch is beautiful. The polished look won't last forever if worn daily, but even when battle-scarred this watch still looks classy. I love that battery replacement is pretty much a non-issue with this watch. Its titanium design makes it so light and comfortable that you might forget you are wearing it. The dial window is pretty resilient, but I would not test that too much. This is for the most part a dress watch. I also have an Invicta Abyss automatic diving watch that I wear occasionally, but I don't wear it nearly as much as I wear my Citizen. --- My Citizen is my favorite watch of all time. Its versatility and longevity have impressed me in the three years that I have owned it. I recommend this watch for anyone who wants a beautiful watch that is dressy and still practical for most daily life. I always get compliments about it also.  ---  --- This watch is a good buy.  --- 	pos
I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!! --- So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from rhe Nikon fots in the new Canon.	neg

In 1980 Michael Weiner saw the publication of Weiner's Herbal: The Guide to Herb Medicine, which states the medical benefits of marijuana [7]. However he recently stated that the chemicals in marijuana make it too dangerous to be used as medicine. On his program, he strongly cautions against the recreational use of marijuana, occasionally devoting his show to "marijuana horror stories" and its claimed potential to ruin lives. He has authored a number of other books on various herbal medicine topics under this name. More recently, Savage's books are political in nature and published by WND Books, a partnership between the conservative website WorldNetDaily and Thomas Nelson, a publisher of Christian books. ---  --- In January 2003 he published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The controversial book directs attacks at "media bias", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gays, and liberals. ---  --- Critics have faulted Savage for making a number of assertions in the book that he often fails to substantiate with facts or resources. Exacerbating this condition is the fact that the book itself has no index. The book is divided into two- to four-page sections, many of which are near-exact replicas to columns he published on the conservative site NewsMax.com. ---  --- In January 2004, Savage published his second political book, The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His newest book, Liberalism is a Mental Disorder was released on April 12, 2005. Both of these books contained citations of nearly every assertion made, contrary to "The Savage Nation." ---  --- In January 2006, Savage announced that he would be releasing a new book, The Political Zoo, in mid-March. [8] The book will contain satirical profiles and cartoons of different people in politics as animals in the "Political Zoo" including one of Savage himself, who will be portrayed as the zookeeper. Savage has remarked that the book will be "easier to digest" than his previous political books. ---  --- Books as Michael Weiner --- Plant a Tree, New York : Collier Books, 1975  --- Bugs in Peanut Butter, Boston : Little, Brown, 1976.  --- Man's Useful Plants, New York: Macmillan. 1976.  --- Earth Medicine, Earth Food, New York : Macmillan Pub.

Michael Savage earned a Bachelor's from Queens College in education and sociology. He taught high school for several years in New York City. Following that, he earned two Master's degrees in ethnobotany and anthropology from the University of Hawaii. He then received a Ph.D. in nutritional ethnomedicine in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji. Savage spent many years researching botany in the South Pacific, and has a background in alternative medicine. He has stated he was a liberal at one time and never served in the military. ---  --- Weiner was a friend of openly gay beat poet Allen Ginsberg, offering to arrange readings for Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 1972. [2] Some of his letters to Ginsberg are held in Ginsberg's archives and one of those letters describes an encounter with a young Fijian man. [3] Savage denies writing the letter and called it part of a "smear campaign" by "gay fascists". [4] Savage also once posed naked for a photograph with Ginsberg while swimming in Fiji. [5] Ferlinghetti views Weiner's reincarnation as Michael Savage as "total opportunism," the crowning achievement of someone who was "always looking to make a fast buck" and "always trying to think up new schemes to get famous." ---  --- Michael Savage began his radio career in 1992 on San Francisco's #1 news/talk radio station KGO, first doing fill in work for other hosts, then getting his own show on the weekend. Two years later he was given a weekday show on KGO's sister station KSFO where he shared airtime with a liberal talk show host. He chose his "nom de voix" in "the Tonga Islands in the 1960s. I stumbled upon the name of a [19th-century] shipwreck who was locally infamous -Charles Savage. His exploits were legendary," he said. "So the name was bouncing around in my head." At the time, his slogan was "To the right of Rush, and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995 he was given his own show during the drive-time hours. The show quickly became a local hit. In 1999, he came to the attention of the Talk Radio Network. ---  --- On January 17, 2000 he started doing an additional two hours of radio which was broadcast nationally. For the next eight months, Savage would spend a total of five hours a day just talking. His national experiment was a success, and on September 21, 2000, he stopped doing separate shows, beginning a full three-hour national show. After just one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in over 200 markets and is currently the No. 3 radio host in the United States. ---  --- In June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO who refused to renegotiate his contract. He was off the air for three weeks. On July 1, 2003 he began his show on a different station: KNEW in San Francisco. Since that dispute, he speaks badly of KSFO and of "Vanity or Pretty Boy" Sean Hannity, whose show replaced his on the station. Savage also speaks pejoratively when referencing his fellow talk radio hosts or individuals with whom he disagrees (see List of Michael Savage neologisms). ---  --- As of 2005, Savage has between 8 million and 10 million listeners per week. This makes his show the third most widely listened to broadcast in the United States. ---  --- In 1996 he applied to be a dean at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. When he was not granted an interview due to lack of qualifications--less than two years of experience in radio, with a Ph.D. in epidemiology and nutrition science--Savage filed a discrimination lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. The position instead went to China scholar Orville Schell who, according to Weiner, was less qualified than himself. ---  --- Savage was hired by MSNBC to do a one-hour show starting March 8, 2003. On July 7, a mere four months later, he was fired for making anti-gay remarks in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller "East Coast Bob." ---  --- Savage was doing an "Airline Horror Stories" piece, when Bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom. His next words were "Half hour into the flight, I need to suggest that Don and Mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad". The words after "should" were bleeped out by a MSNBC exec, which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about Savage's sexual orientation. Savage asked if he was a "sodomite", to which the caller answered "yes" . Savage then said to the caller: "Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig, how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage, you got nothing better to do today, go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on....no more calls? I don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages." [6] ---  --- Before the show was canceled, MSNBC was replaying his show during primetime hours Saturday night; many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments, and that MSNBC was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups. Others point out that MSNBC has had poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and gone quickly on the network. --- 	neg
I received the MV50 for Christams to air up my RAM 1500 Megacab after surf fishing. I gave it a trial run in my driveway today and was very happy. I dropped my front tire down to 15 PSI.

Great compilation of songs from Massive Attack, all of their singles plus new never release songs. The videos are great and their new single 'live with me' is a great song (very sad video though). Includes new version/remix of 'I want you' with madonna. The combo is great you can own ALL of the videos, is a lot of fun to see the videos from blue lines until 100th window from the 90s all the way to the new single, the changes in the way they used to make music videos. There's even the first video with Tricky).  ---  --- A must have for any massive attach fan, and if you never heard from this band, you get the best of the best with this cds/dvd. Massive Attack is a band that had influenced a lot of artist from Bjork, Tricky, Madonna, Morcheeba, Portishead, UNKLE, etc.   ---  --- 	pos
What a wonderful and diverse CD.  Sit in front of a fire on a rainy day with a nice glass of Oregon Pinot Noir in your hand.  Close your eyes relax and let the sounds of Liebert surround you.  His talent is evident in the expressions as he's playing.  The guitar seems an extension of his own form, not a separate instrument. 	pos

I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).   They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.	neg
I like these a lot.  They are only slightly salty, with a bit of molasses sweetness, all balanced against a mild licorice flavor.  They are medium-hard and very chewy, although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard.  Personally I would prefer a stronger licorice flavor, but these are still among my favorites. ---  --- Salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who haven't tried it before.  If you've never had it before, don't start with a case (like what's sold here).  And definitely stay away from Double Salt licorice until you've learned whether you like the saltiness. ---  --- If you want black licorice but don't want the salty flavor, try "Haribo licorice wheels". Those have more licorice flavor than these coins, and less other flavor.  They're a bit sweet and a bit softer. ---  --- Note that these coins also come in bags.  Buying them that way is slightly more cost-effective, but the tubs might be a little more airtight	pos
with a well crafted script, good actors at the heights of their powers and brisk no nonsense direction. Emma Thompson has done better work since but Kenneth Branagh hasn't unfortunately.   ---  --- Too bad really.  Branagh may still be a pretty good director but I think working with Emma is what lent him an appeal and warmth on screen that he has not been able to recapture. His Hamlet was glossy, chilly, unpleasant and too old.  Nevertheless, I'm grateful that we at least have this, as well as his Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing	pos
I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products.  This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!   ---  --- It is moderately spicy, but if you don't mind a bit if spice, this one is just too good to pass up.  I could practically live off of this stuff! ---  --- Thank you, Annie Chun, for making a packaged meal worth eating	pos
I thought I would love this, but it just takes too much time and energy.  Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva.  Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc.  I just don't see the difference in that and not using it.  My hands touch it, baby's hands touch it etc.  I have enough to keep track of with a bag, baby, wallet, cell phone....I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material!  My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar....that is far more effective against germs.  You are better off buying a $3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky, ineffective cloth	neg
I'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying ANYTHING, so it was on a leap of faith that I bought Natural Health magazine without reading anything about it.  A friend suggested it, and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before, I caved in and bought the July/August 2005 copy immediately. ---  --- Let me start off by saying that I'm an extremely picky person.  I have extremely high standards for every purchase I make, and I absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if I find a fault. ---  --- Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I will mention that I was thoroughly impressed with Natural Health.  Long ago, I subscribed to New Age magazine (now known as Body & Soul, which I do not care for).  It was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips and advice.  I cannot stand redundancy, incorrect information and excessive advertising.  I found that Natural Health was much more long the lines of the former New Age magazine, filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the $3.95 I paid. ---  --- To give you an idea of what the magazine includes, here is a small sampling of the articles I found in the July/August issue: ---  --- Small articles include: ---  --- - "To bee or not to bee", a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen, royal jelly, propolis, and honey, stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are. --- - "How can I get relief from PMS?" Experts (including a Naturopath, Gynecologist and Dietitian) answer this question with excellent responses. --- - "Medicine Cabinet: attack of the weekend warrior" Natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors. --- - "Clothes to pose in" Great yoga gear! --- - "Medical Breakthroughs" --- - "Healing Supplements:  8 ways to beat anxiety" --- - "Fitness Fix - knee savers" ---  --- Longer articles include: ---  --- - "Healthy Appetites: savvy strategies for eating well" Delicious, healthy recipes and tips. --- - "Good medicine: a clean, healthy mouth" A well-researched article on "mercury fillings, fluoride toothpaste and the best at-home remedies". --- - "Five Paths to Peace" Five simple meditation techniques. --- - "Eat to Beat The Heat: Yin Foods" More great recipes! --- - "Sacred Spaces" - making your home your personal retreat. ---  --- This is only a sampling; in fact, that's less than half of the magazine alone.  Some articles are fairly short, but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across.  My personal favorite was the last page, "Make One Change", where this month's change is to "upgrade your z's".  It included simple tips that I was able to implement immediately. ---  --- The amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual (probably about the same amount as you'd find in a Yoga Journal, but not nearly as many as in Oprah magazine), and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus. ---  --- Judging by the past reviews on Natural Health, it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003-2004 timeframe.  Let's remember that magazines change editors frequently.  I found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue, but that may not be so in future issues years from now.  As for me, I want a subscription ASAP	pos
I think the Floppy Seat is a great idea -- aside from the cleanliness factor, my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area; this way, I can pad him in and he's secure.  However, I find it very difficult to manage.   ---  --- I see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- I say kudos to her because I find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb. baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other!  The elastic keeps it on when it's on, but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart... I challenge you to do it with one hand! ---  --- Also, I think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous. I am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out. ---  --- All of that being said, once baby is properly "installed", it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles	neg
This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.

We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!	pos
Compass worked wonderfully for my trip around New England this summer. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving. Remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window. I forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later. Never came off again the whole trip after I moistened them.  Worth the money.	pos

This was the first bottle I purchased for my daughter when she was born.  I was breastfeeding but since she had jaundice, I had to suppliment formula for the first 2 weeks of her life!  I had the worst time with this bottle!  It leaked everytime I went to shake it and whenever I would try to feed my daughter she would literaly drown because the flow was too fast.  SHe would also gag and had horrible gas! I stopped with the formula till she was 6 weeks and I thought maybe since she was older she could take it a little better.  It ended up being the same problems again!!  I switched to the playtex nurser and those bottles are great! I would recommend them to anyone who is breast and bottle feeding!

This was my first year using Turbotax, and it's also my last! ---  --- Since 1992 I was a faithful user of HR Block's Taxcut for Mac.  In spite of it costing more than the Windows version, I used it every year except for 1995 when various problems related to my AOL dial-up service prevented me from using it.  Since TurboTax is the only option out there for people who use a Mac, you'd think I'd be continuing to use them for now on, - but you'd be wrong! ---  --- I purchased my copy of TurboTax Deluxe from Amazon.com to save $5.  Since TaxCut made certain that no information from it's software could ever be imported by other software, I filled in my personal data as I began.  I was a little disappointed that TurboTax doesn't allow you to skip the "step-by-step" method, and just fill in the actual forms the way TaxCut did as an option.    While the downloads were an annoyance (6 or 7 separate files each time), for the most part the software was OK.  Picking up from where you leave off wasn't always possible, but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back to the right spot. ---  --- My first major annoyance came with the state software.  After filling in some data, and seeing the overall results, I wanted to look at the forms to see what they were doing with my data.  I also needed to see where they had placed data that was imported from the federal information I'd entered.  Well, there's no way to see your data on state forms until you're finished and print them out (or preview as .pdf files from the print dialogue).  When you do that the software somehow magically creates the state forms for printing, but the state forms don't seem to exist anywhere else except in that print spool!  I found this extremely annoying, and a real time waster. ---  --- The final blow, however, was when I got to filing.  The advertising is an unnecessary annoyance.  Since I don't owe any state taxes, I just usually print those forms out and mail them in --- it doesn't make any sense to me to pay for filing something when I don't owe anything and I'm not going to benefit from that "faster" refund.  Then I came to the crusher.  TurboTax wanted $30 for e-filing my Federal forms!!  TaxCut charged $14.95 and $15.95, but then they always rebated the cost.  I was told that Intuit used to do that, but obviously they decided to make some additional money this year.  Earlier in the day that I filed the saw the head of the IRS on CNBC being interviewed. He said that e-filing makes their job so much simpler.  Well, if it helps them that much, they should devise a way for computer users who buy software to file returns directly to the IRS without Intuit, H R Block and the others as middlemen.  And they should let us file for free if it makes their work so much easier. ---  --- While I have had my doubts about the services that allow you to fill out online forms, and then do your filing for you, I haven't heard of any security problems with them, so that's the direction I'm planning to take next year.  As far as I'm concerned, TurboTax blew it by being unfair with their e-filing fees	neg
There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could.

Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought	neg
I like sardines, much to my wife's dismay.  I can eat them right out of the can.  However, skinless and boneless they have to be and that is becoming an expensive variety. ---  --- How nice it was, then, to find that Amazon is selling the Reese brand at very attractive prices.  I've tried both the 3.75 and 4.375 oz cans, in olive oil of course--purchase 30 or 40 cans at a time--and have been quite well pleased. ---  --- I prefer the larger can.  In my experience, the 4.375 is packed with smaller sardines that tend to have a more delicate taste.  At least that was my opinion respecting those that are netted and packed in Morocco, as most sardines that I have been buying are. ---  --- That brings me to the single problem I encountered in a recent purchase of the 4.375 oz Reese product.  While the web page for it called it out as a product of Morocco, what arrived was a product of Portugal.  The box graphics as shown on the website was different, too, and the sardines were larger and firmer than those of Morocco. ---  --- Although, still tasteful and a great value, too, I prefer the Moroccan variety.  It's that more delicate taste that I seek.  For most and for me, as well, the product source is certainly a minor point, but I did call the issue to Amazon's attention. ---  --- Amazon is great when it comes to feedback and actually seeks it, but I do not know how my comments were ultimately dealt with.  The website still shows the product as Moroccan and package graphics different than the packaging that I received.   ---  --- Of course, the website includes info and pictures that Reese provides.  Reese probably shipped the Portuguese variety without advising Amazon of the change.  It could be that I will not know what is actually being shipped until I make my next purchase	pos
Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone. ---  --- The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. --- The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. --- Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. --- As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!	neg

I've never been quite a fan of music DVDs.  By that I mean the live stuff.  I much rather be there to experience it then sit at home pretending I'm there.  That's one side of it.  I'm also a huuuuuge Gorillaz fan.  And I have seen them live.  The show to their self titled debut. But don't get me wrong, that doesn't make me biased towards everything they put out.  On the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level because I only expect the best from what they've given. ---  --- With that said, this has to be literally one of the best music DVDs I have encountered in quite some time.  Don't worry about extras, documentaries, which while would have been nice to show how it was put together, are not here.  Which makes sense since the band itself is very discreet they wouldn't show you all that. ---  --- The show itself was amazing, and it literally jumps off screen as you watch this, and I recommend you have a decent audio system as well.  The amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals is astonishingly done well.  The editing and the post production were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love and not just another DVD to sell.  From start to end it will leave you speechless.  As you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the Gorillaz, you realise that while at first you figured them to be a fictious band in every aspect, they are quite real and very capable of producing grand music on every level.  You can tell by this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the encore.  Only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically on such a deep level. And to put on such a show which normally you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to produce is a feat in itself. ---  --- If you want special features videos and documentaries get the 2 other DVDs especially now since they just released their newest one.  Those will fill in all that nicely.  But even if you're not a fan or just a new convert, I highly recommend you own this.  No matter the age, or person you are, (you notice this on the DVD as well) and regardless of what your favourite genre is.  Because they are so massive they can't be contained into one. ---  --- Thank you Damon and Jamie for such an experience, mates	pos
I recently purchased this clock and it's a great little clock! The time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful. The projection (usually on the ceiling) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening. ---  --- The only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down. I mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down.  ---  --- The atomic feature was a bit tricky also. I live in central NJ and when setting up the clock for the first time it didn't pick up any signal. After I searched for a signal, took the batteries out and tried everything I knew and everything the manual mentioned it wouldn't get a signal. So I had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions, the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal (by pressing the down arrow) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal, which is shown by the meter on the left, like a cell phone. Once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself (you may need to take it outside)...this can take from 10 mins to days. In my case it took about 5 mins. So it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal. Other than that problem, which is fixed, the clock is hassle free and very easy to use.i highly recommend it. Oregon Scientific was also helpful and I sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual, because if they did I wouldn't have needed to bother email the customer service. Hopefully most people didn't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they didn't they may have returned the clock needlessly. ---  --- The alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor. ---  --- Overall it's a cute, useful, and stylish clock.	pos

Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions. ---  --- It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free. ---  --- I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.) ---  --- It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking. ---  --- 	neg

It used to be (and it has been a couple years since I have bought a computer game new) that as long as your PC was not too old, you could run any game on it.  No so with Oblivion (and some other new games I believe).  To run Oblivion (as is) you need a machine with a high end graphics card.  So unless you bought a PC specifically for gaming, or specifically updated the graphics card, Oblivion will just quit after the intro screen, without telling you why!  While I readily accept that not having a high end graphics card will mean that games will not look as good, it is frustrating that this game will not even run on my PC (a dual core, with 1G of RAM).  And no, it still does not run if you install the manufacturer's patch. ---  --- However all is not completely lost.  I was able to install "Oldblivion" (just Google for it to find the site) and another patch from the Oldblivion site and now it runs acceptably.  With Oldblivion and the other patch the graphics are still pretty good (better than Morrowind though understandably not nearly as good as the screenshots online), however it tends to crash every so often (its unclear whether or not this is due to graphics incompatibilities or just other bugs in the game). ---  --- Nonetheless, if have a high end graphics card, or have the patience to apply all the unofficial online patches, the game is pretty cool.  I was not a big fan of Morrowind, but Oblivion has a number of improvements over Morrowind (in my opinion): ---  --- 1) You can fast travel (just open up a map and click) to all cities and any sites that you have been to before.  And even when you cannot fast travel to a new place, you can usually walk in a nearly straight line there (in Morrowind it was maddening to go someplace since I often would end up running into mountains that I could not climb) ---  --- 2) Oblivion is not so dark and gloomy, like Morrowind was! ---  --- 3) NPC speak (this to me is a huge benefit, in Morrowind they might utter some cryptic phrase when they saw you but then you would have to to through pages of text dialouge -- if I wanted to read I would pick up a book, not play a computer game!) ---  --- 4) There is a quest arrow that points towards the person you need to see.  In Morrowind it was incredibly tedious to track people down! ---  --- 5) And finally a minor point, the names of people do not look like the programmers mashed the hand on the keyboard (in Morrowind there were quests like "go see ERAJGUKADFHS and ask about SAKDFHSLKDJF".  I just don't need that when I am playing a computer game! ---  --- One thing that I do not care for about Oblivion is the way the monsters level with you.  The first character I had, I got up to level 15 and found myself being beaten up by goblins!  Unless you powergame (that is stragically plan your leveling to maximize stats and combat skills) or turn the difficulty way down, the leveling of monsters makes the game a real pain -- combat related quests (such as with the painted trolls) should not get harder the more you level. ---  --- All in all it is a pretty fun game, but before you buy, make sure you have a high end graphics card (or a lot of patience)! ---  ---  	pos
I agree with the comments about the taste and size.  Personally I think someone should look into the false advertising.  On the preztel kit, which is also a "4 pack", you only get two pretzels.  One of the packs is salt and another is glaze.  Then you get two packs of some pretzel dough.  These pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine. ---  --- Total rip-off.  Hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff	neg

I have read and subscribed to Organic Gardening (and Farming)since mid-70's but dropped my subscription in and around 2000. I pick up an issue now and then in newstands, just to "check in" and hope for a return to the "good ole days". The publication used to be superior (find old issues in a library to see the what I mean - especially the 70's) and gave tons of information to all levels of gardeners (some issues used to have 100's of pages, almost all text - though in a smaller format). I still have old copies and to this day find inspiration in those articles. Now its just LARGE glossy pictures, sparse writing, reduced page counts, basic gardening info/lists and more than a dose of Maria Rodale's opinion/politics. I guess their surveys/advertisers tell them this is what "organic" gardeners want...but I would bet Robert Rodale (who edited the mag back in 70's and early 80's) would be upset to see how his daughter has screwed up the magazine. Save your subscription and read the old ones at a library. Yeah...the varieties will be out of date (that's what a seed catalog is good for and/or seedsavers.org) but the info is pure "organic gardening"	neg

This book is very disappointing, as is most of Gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. It's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin Laden and AQ are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as JI) are AQ franchises - total bollocks.

I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares.

I just bought my first laptop computer and really, really hated the touchpad.

All the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month. I couldnt ask for better all round performance.

How he makes money "acting" is amazing to me.  These Hollywood versions of a fake historic events make me cringe.  Especially when Hollywood exec's send their " talent" to making the rounds on talk shows to plug the painful" blockbuster" that's going to be a BIG FLOP and they know it but they think people are stupid (and most of us are) but Hollywood hates to lose money so they put a spin on it anyway, I'd laugh if it wern't so sad.  Anyway, Tom's army unit was choosen to update the Japanese army at the request of the puppet emperor , but really it's the emperor's councelor who makes all the decisions, so, the evil councelor decides to "westernize" his army the samuri swordsmen must be totally destroyed.  Tom accidently on purpose kills a samuri and feels bad so he tries to make it up to the wife and son then he realizes a brutal beauty to the life of a samuri and joins them.  It's very paint by the numbers story and acting, even the Japanese landscape is boring.  Of course the U.S. Army is painted as bad guys when the whole blame for the mess and bloodshed that follows can be put squarely on the shoulders of the weak emperor who didn't have the guts to put things right with the samuri in the first place. Then Tommy has some kind of ephifany and decides to stay in Japan. Snore. This movie was too long, and with all the money spent on this movie it really could have been a 1/2 decent semi-historic story about the destruction of the samuri in Japan	neg
While this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses, I cannot recommend it to other readers. The author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-Republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical Christianity. She battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all Bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel. Indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a Christian worldview that might veer in any part from Republican platform positions. This is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions. I would not have begrudged her political point of view at all, had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position	neg
    They say it will be delivered in its original carton, but they don't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones. ---  ---     The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands, and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery. Later that evening, when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open, the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open. I cut the box open and started laying the parts out. when I pulled the carton containing the console out, the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam. every thing else looked undisturbed. I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned, the bubble wrap was torn, and the six screws to mount it were missing. ---  ---    I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws, and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on, I would have sent it back, but I had cut the box open and don't think there is any way I could cram it all back together.  ---  ---    Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it, the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed. They sure fooled me into accepting a opened box.	neg

I thought these would be just as good. ($15 dollars more than the 100ct box, But just as good & there's 180 of them, instead of 100).  WRONG! --- These are really bad. They were all dried out & hard as rocks, and  to top it off, They expire on the 24th of Feb. Less then a month from now. I've never had this problem with Amazon before. Usually their stuff is fresh. You will not be able to return them either. Once they are opened you are stuck with them. I contacted Amazon about this problem & they gave me a little of my money back.

While the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive.  What I think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics.  An example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together.  He just tells you that you need to tie them together.  What if you don't have a shoelace to use?  What other alternates are there?  This book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire, but it's not enough for the serious camper	neg
I've seen better high end audio books. I'm certainly not a member of the aforementioned "Scientific School of Audio System Performance Analysis", the only instruments that can accurately measure sound quality are the ones on either side of your head. I listen to what my ears tell me sounds good, and generally, tubes sound good. Which is why this book is sort of a disappointment, you'd think that out of 80 projects there'd be at least one tube phono preamp, but unfortunately there are no tube amps, just a few rants about how tubes don't produce enough power. Who uses more than a watt anyway? Even the transistor amps presented aren't much better than what you could get from Rex or Circuit City, similar schematics could probably be found on the internet for free.

For ease of use, The Deltran Battery Tender is an excellent way to charge and maintain the battery on your motorcycle, snowmobile, or even a heavy- duty vibrator, not that I would know anything about that! The kit includes a BMW type plug for machines so equipped, and an SAE adaptor with alligator clips.  You can also wire the SAE adaptor right to your bike's battery and have easy access to the plug- in.  The battery is maintained in a peak state of charge, with no worries of over charging	pos

I was a little reluctant to purchase these because I had heard a lot of things about the spring mechanism in them being faulty but that they were being recalled and fixed.  So I was wondering if the one I bought was a fixed model or not.  Well, it must have the newer design because I've been using these for a few months and I have nothing but good things to say about them.  I was previously using a long OXO set of tongs which were pretty good but a little flimsy for some of the heftier cuts of meat like, whole chickens and pork shoulders.  These tongs are sturdy!  You know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them.  They can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and, because of the 20 inch length, you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire.  The handle has grooves for your fingers and thumbs which enhances the grip and they lock in a closed position for storage. --- If you do any outdoor cooking, you will appreciate these tongs.  They're a well thought out piece of equipment you'll use for years and be glad you purchased	pos
I've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie.

I regret buying this gun. It broke within four days of buying it. We did just enough shooting to adjust the hop-up(for accuracy), and it fired great. It was really accurate. The gun was made of really cheap plastic, and the trigger stopped working. Right now, we're waiting for a RMA on it. I would recommend paying a little extra, to buy a more durable gun. I bought another gun that cost $55, and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable	neg

This unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood	pos

 --- The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.  ---  --- The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: "His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.  --- There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: "No man suffers pains of love on the stage." For dealing with the infatuated man: "You have wounded yourself, but not with love."  ---  --- This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.  ---  --- Well-made period romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree". I rated "Persuasion" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however "Persuasion" is 5-stars compared to this "Mansfield Park". "Persuasion" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book. 	neg

I really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great.  A shocking murder is committed in the town of Newpointe, then another.  Meanwhile, fireman Mark Branning has moved out and is separated from his wife Allie.  There is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and Allie and Mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage.  I wanted to like this book because it is a Christian novel with a good purpose.  Ninety percent of the books I've read have been secular but I'm starting to read more Christian novels.  But to me, this book fails for three reasons:  the marriage conflict between Mark and Allie isn't believable, the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight, and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing.   ---  --- Mark and Allie's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn't convinced her otherwise.  Seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery, but it is grounds for suspicion.  Yet, Allie assumes Mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman.  It seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight.  Instead, Mark and Allie separate and Allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair.   ---  --- Blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between Mark and Allie.  Throughout the book, references are made to Allie believing Mark had an affair with Issie.  Allie refers to Mark's act as "adultery" and recalls him "lying" his way out of it after Allie caught him hugging Issie.  Their marriage is struggling, but Blackstock should have given more reasons why Allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book, Mark says he didn't have an affair and Allie chalks it up to one of his lies. ---  --- Later in the novel, Blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late. ---  --- The serial killer story is poorly done, and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book.  When they book a suspect at the end, it seems ridiculous.  The police work feels like it was written by an amateur.  One line in the novel, "As much as the evidence pointed to XXX, Stan didn't want to believe it."  In my opinion, the evidence didn't point to that person and Stan, the detective, seems foolish for believing it.  There isn't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story.  There is no sense of setting in the book.  There are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other. ---  --- Finally, this book talks about God and prayer and being "saved" throughout the book, and that's great.  With a serial killer on the loose, a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way.   ---  --- At one point, a conversation goes like this:  "How can the murder be part of God's plan?"  "Maybe it isn't"  "That would mean God isn't in control."  "He is in control, but he allows some things to happen." ---  --- Then at another point, Mark says to Allie, "I'm going to be fine, it's time to trust the Lord.  He's taken care of us so far." ---  --- Then Allie says:  "But I don't know what his plan is.  I don't know how he wants this to end.  I don't know what he wants to teach us." ---  --- At other points in the book, characters say that God has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of God's plan and that through God's plan, all things can be used for good.  This line of logic is infuriating.  Bad things happen to everyone, including God's people.  God doesn't "allow" a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife.  That's a horrible message to send to a non-Christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck.  Telling them it was part of God's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from God. ---  --- God is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and God can even keep bad things from happening to Christians.  But like above, where Allie was afraid because she thought God might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson, God doesn't willfully kill people.  It comes down to the simple fact that all people, including serial killers and Christians, have choices to make and have free will. ---  --- I'm surprised I wrote so much on an 8 year old book but I wanted it to be a good book. 	neg
The Young Rider is the BEST horse magazine for kids. It encourages horse lovers to love horses even more. It has great tips on riding English and Western saddle.

Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900, making it less high-maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing, headset using, and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time.  Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind.  It's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars.  What!?  Aside from the piddling cost of this battery (which is about double the tax you'd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership), there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside.  To me, this is not insignificant, but is ignorable, as it doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing, talking, or using the buttons	pos

I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera.  It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera.

If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.  Cheers	neg
I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. --- Bad poetry from a twisted man	neg

This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality.  ---  --- I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer.  ---  --- The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.  ---  --- Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.  ---  --- I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.  ---  --- A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.  ---  --- For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea. That was the first Tazo tea I tasted and so far I can't think of a Tazo tea I don't love.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review --- 	pos

This game is so much fun! I don't own it, but my friend does, and I want to get it for my birthday. But I think I should tell you why exactly anyone needs to own this game! --- First of all, there are 50 songs to sing. Some you have to unlock, but all you have to do is sing an already available song. You're rated on the notes you are supposed to sing, and if you don't exactly know the lyrics, you can just hum along if you want to. --- There is a character editor where you can make your name, characteristics and clothing for a character. Or you can pick an already made character. The thing which is totally descriptive is that you can pick the body type of your character: muscular, curvy, skinny...the works. --- There are unlockables, too! Over the course of the game, you unlock songs, outfits, and accessories!  --- You can also do medly and sing-off activities. Medly is when you pick 5 songs and sing individual parts of each of them. Sing-off (I can't remember if that is the actual name) is when you do different types of styles of the game. So you can do short song, medly, and all kinds of other things. Then you can see "who will be named champion of karaoke!" --- This game is incredibly fun and enjoyable, as you can see. If you do buy it, I suggest you buy two microphones, then you can sing duets (also incredibly fun). This game is perfect for all ages; my neighbors have children at the age of 7 and he loves singing his heart out to some of his favorite songs. So take my word for it, and you will be thankful you did	pos
Okay, here is the deal.  This thing is built well, but it's dimensions and performance work against it.  It's height and width are just right for a pocket book, but it's thickness gets it in trouble.  It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it.  Hell, it might even pull your pants down.  The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience).  If you are looking for a real nice small notebook, opt for a Moleskine.  Pass on this clunker	neg
Early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the New Republic as you explore their base, with no force powers. But events make a turn for the worse and you go to Luke and request for your lightsaber back. Then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark Jedi/killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game. With amazing graphics and increddible duels, this game is simply magnificent. Plus the multiplayer is awesome (especially when you play CTF and give the other team a boat load of Storm Troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so Stormtroopers makes the game a game you'll never want to trade in! Plus the duels are fun to play again and again. I would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult.

There are better guns out there, but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard, this is the gun for you. The sight is a pretty nice feature.	neg
We picked up this candle at Hudson News as we were departing Seattle. It smells absolutley amazing. I was so happy to find out that they are available online, now I can finally buy more	pos
First of all, let me say this product is great in almost every way. So if you need to feel better about your nose and/or throat, go for it. ---  --- My main complain about the Grossan Hydro Pulse is that it is noticeably expensive. Some time ago, Grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a Waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the Hydro Pulse. But then, Grossan decided to produce his own machine and, if I'm right, Viajet is making it for him. Viajet sells the same machine, except for the Grossan tip, at about -again- a half the price of the Hydro Pulse.  The Breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive (I have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country). ---  --- So what makes the Hydro Pulse so expensive? Maybe health is a business, after all. ---  --- Other than that, like I have said, this product is great for almost any respiratory problem. I used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle, and is intended to use it over 50 times. The Hydro Pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime, so you get the idea. ---  --- Also, if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment, look for the Buteyko Method	pos
Im a truck driver that dosent drink coffee. Can you believe it!? --- My hours are really weird as my day may start at 8AM or at 8PM & I might work for 10 to 14 hours per shift. Ive used half a bottle to a full bottle at a time & have always gotten the boost I need to get where Im going. I also may use it to start my day or to finish it.  --- I started using 5 hour about 6 months ago. I dont use it everyday but when I need it, it works well. The nice thing is, when I finally call it a day I can lay down & get to sleep. Unlike other products Ive used, I dont have that ragged feeling afterward. --- I purchase in quantities of 100 & carry 25 or so on the road.	pos
My 7 year old saw the ads for DigiDraw and drove me absolutely crazy until Christmas rolled around last year. The look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived. --- It was nearly impossible to assemble. The time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old. The only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils	neg
Well, for me it's a curious thing. ---  --- The Jellifish changes a lot the texture of the pluck when you strum or do arpeggios but it's a little fragile. ---  --- I like it so that I play with it a lot of time since I bought it but I have a strong strumming stile so the tires, the largest ones, are breaking from the root. This is not a flaw of the Jellifish, they are very clear about that to produce the sounds they say it's better to do it by light strum and picking. It's just that I get emotional when I play, jajaja. ---  --- I also founded a way to use it as a physical cello bow. Note this pick is for textures cause it not produces an effect like a pedal. ---  --- It's a smart product that could bring some new life in your playing, but only if you're open minded and don't expect a pick and neither a pedal effect kind of sound.  ---  --- I only want I always have a new one available, they have a 6 month lifetime I read somewhere in the jellifish page. --- 	pos
they got the texture and the level of sweetness just right.  These were fabulous if a tad bit expensive.  For a special treat I would buy these again	pos
I've been using this product for awhile, and I'm delighted with it. I got my Algebra I Homework done in 1/5 the time it usually takes me! In addition to this, when I feel like learning, I watch some of the Discovery Channel videos that are included with this. Even better is that this product comes with a $[...], reducing its overall price to $[...]. Today I'm going to use it to help me write a five paragraph essay. ---  --- I love Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007, and you will too! Buy it! Trust me, you WON'T be disappointed	pos
I owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me, and I said "THANK YOU!" because I hated the thing.  I used to have a 4mp Samsung and it was better than this one.   ---  --- The worst problem: Slow.  Slow slow slow.  If you use the flash, be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture.  It's worse at low battery strength, but even with fresh batteries it was tedious. ---  --- The other thing that disappointed me was the color.  The light from the flash is glaring and unnatural, and without the flash everything is reddish, grainy, and blurry.  I never found a decent middle ground.  I take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light, and my Samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one.  When I look at the pictures I've uploaded on my computer, I can see the difference when my old camera died and I got the Nikon. ---  --- The worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing I owned THAT one. ---  --- Do some research before you make a mistake like I did. I've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera	neg
I had this album for many years when I was younger. I had looked for along --- time to try and find it on CD with no luck.  I finally found it on Amazon. This is my favorite christmas album,  I even have my teenage daughter hooked on it now. The caroling medely is awesome and My daugher loves the Pinecones and Hollyberries song.  No one should be without this --- CD in their Christmas Collection. 	pos
I purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months. The shoes are very comfortable and look very professional. Love them.  ---  --- Strong and tough. --- Not to heavy. Has good grip on snow.	pos
This young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice, albeit a little underpowered, but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture. There is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties. In fact, I suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short-shorts. Once again, sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art	neg
I'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if I said that care of lenses for SLR cameras required a decent lens cap.  This one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses (Canon and otherwise), so just be sure to confirm that that it's the proper size for your lens	pos
There's certainly a lot to hate about Wine Spectator - and, for that matter, Wine Advocate. Many winemakers decry the existence of both magazines, and usually lay the blame entirely at Robert Parker's doorstep for making the 100-point rating system an industry standard. ---  --- Wine Spectator's scores have gotten better with time, as have their articles. They've shied away from California "glitz" and have looked more into food. Also, the education classes that they list on their website are becoming increasingly more helpful. ---  --- Apparently they listened to much of the criticism and worked toward creating a more respected magazine. I think they've done well.	pos
This was the first Wii game I got, and its mostly because I couldn't get a hold of Zelda.  Red Steel looks promising.  Certainly its controls are good, but it feels more like a game that's supposed to get you used to using the remote and nunchuck attachment.  A tutorial of sorts.  The problem is that it isn't much fun to deal with.  ---  --- You play as Scott, a man in Japan with his girlfriend.  You suddenly find out that her father is a Yakuza Mob boss and that he's got tons of enemies.  Your girlfriend gets kidnapped and so its up to you to save her, ultimately getting yourself involved in this family struggle.  It's pretty simple stuff.  Most of the game is told through voice acted cutscenes or graphic novel like storyboards.  The graphic novel storyboards look interesting, but its really painful that you can't skip any of these cinematics or storyboard cutscenes.  This is especially annoying when you die and you have to listen to the same objective over and over again.  ---  --- Red Steel's appeal is its gameplay, which seems to be the focus of the game.  The controls are solid, for the most part, but again, the whole game seems like a tutorial to get used to the Wii remote.  You use the remote to aim at enemies and the B button to shoot.  The nunchuck allows you to pick up weapons, reload said weapon and tip over tables (you'll know what can be accessed because it has a golden outline around it).  The nunchuck is also how you'll move around.  You can strife from side to side and you can move forward.  The nunchuck also allows you to jump and duck.  You'll be doing a lot of ducking. ---  --- The remote is responsible for most of the gameplay.  It allows you to turn from one side of the screen to another.  The game itself will help you get adjusted with a tutorial provided at the beginning of the game (with your grifriend directing you what fish to look at).  You'll be able to use the remote for several things.  You can lock onto enemies with the A button and if you hold the A button you can zoom into enemies by moving the wii remote closer to the screen, or you can zoom out.  It's all pretty cool, but the remote is extremely sensitive.  Just the slightest flick to the left and you'll look to the left.  It's great to actually point and shoot at an enemy, your accuracy is really important, but now it's all up to you whether or not you hit an enemy.  Granted, the controls take time to get used to, but they flow particularly well.  ---  --- Swordfights are another story, though.  These are annoying sequences actually.  Mostly because the controls are clumbsy.  You'll have to swing your sword using the wii remote and you'll parry and dodge attacks using the nunchuck.  At first this is fun, but its so limited.  When fighting with swords you can't pull out a weapon.  This is bad when you're in the middle of a firefight and some guy has a sword.  You'll be forced into the sword fight even when all the enemies using guns are still up.  And they'll STILL fire at you and you'll lose health.  There's no way to back out of sword fights either, and that's also really annoying.  The controls just feel clumbsy as well, especially with its extreme sensitivty.   ---  --- To the gameplay's credit, there are some interesting things you can do.  For starters, when you're not shooting someone and you're ducking behind something, your health refills.  At first this makes the game seem easy, but you have to understand that if you're taking damage, or shooting at all, your health doesn't refill.  So this doesn't make the game incredibly easy.  Also, after a sword fight, you'll have the choice of finishing your attacker off or sparing his life.  Sparing his life earns you respect, which you can use to learn more techniques.   ---  --- The game doesn't look fantastic, but it's not bad looking either.  It's visual presentation is alright, but the part of the graphics that lacks are the games numerous bugs and glitches.  There are moments where you'll be staring an enemy right in the face and he won't move.  Won't flinch or even attack you.  He just stands there waiting to be killed.  Sometimes enemies will run right past you or claim they can't see you when you're in plain sight.  There are also moments where I shot an enemy in the back and neither him nor his comrades even acknowledged my existence.  There are probably more bugs than this found within the game, but it was hard to take after a while.     ---  --- There are a couple of other annoying aspects of the gameplay as well.  You can only hold two weapons at a time.  This isn't as annoying as it sounds, but I wish I could've held on to more.  Luckily, ammo is not hard to come by at all.  There are also glitches such as your bullets passing right through an enemy while he takes you out.  Enemies shooting through walls.  This game is just full of them. ---  --- I wish I could say it sounds good, but it doesn't.  The voice acting is very mediocre and the soundtrack isn't great either.  Some levels sound good, but there's nothing memorable here.   ---  --- Red Steel has a good control scheme going for it but that's really all it has going for it.  It's not a fantastic game by any means.  The bugs and glitches strewn throughout are also just really annoying.  It's hard to recommend this game, even to die hard first person shooter fans.  ---  --- The Good ---  --- +The control scheme works --- +Well, there is lots of action ---  --- The Bad ---  --- -Tons of bugs and glitches found throughout the whole game: enemies who don't attack, or walk right past you.  Enemies who can't see you in plain sight.  Bullets going through walls or through your enemies... this game is full of them and they detract from the gameplay --- -Sword fighting is clumbsy --- -You can only wield two weapons at once.  --- -When you're forced into a sword fight, there's no way you can get out of it until the fight is over --- -Horrible voice acting --- -There's really no story to it --- -The controls, while good, just seem like another ploy to get one used to the Wii Remot	neg
I ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did. I have a Stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade, an extra battery, and an extra picture card. There are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover. In the main compartment, a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money. (It won't fit much more than that, though.) It's compact, stylish and functional--I'm glad I bought it	pos
Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.  No problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems.  The brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and I use it as a night light in the kitchen.  The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.  This is a Thomson Inc product (purchased the GE & RCA names several years ago) that makes TV's ect. --- I am very happy with the product and recommend it	pos
Not as they appear!, March 8, 2007 --- Reviewer: Rappster (Denver, CO) - See all my reviews  --- I ordered these earrings on a 'Gold Box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive. They were SUCH a disappointment, I returned them the next day. I did not expect the diamonds to be huge, based on their cttw, but the earrings themselves are miniscule! They look like they were made for children. I tried on one earring and couldn't even SEE the earring in my ear, much less tell there were any diamonds--it looked like I didn't even have an earring on! ---  ---  ---   --- 	neg
The battery does not hold up. After 10 months it would not work at all. I thought it was the battery. Emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable. I found one and changed it out myself. The unit was just dead. Warranty is 60 days. ---  Will not buy another one	neg
I don't consider myself a hardocre 50 Cent fan, but I went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of XXL.  It wasn't all that entertaining.  The documentary doesn't really tell the people anything that we don't already know.  We've seen all these videos before, but the video for "Heat" is straight wack.  The street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny.  The Show In Detroit isn't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that's being said.  The sessions @ AOL are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 Mile DVD trailer?  The DVD borders on corny, but the CD isn't that bad.  These are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs, but I had not been able to find the "8 Mile Road (G Unit Remix)" ever since I lost my underground CD.  Lloyd Banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this CD / DVD release.  If you're a Young Buck fan, you should know that he's nowhere to be found on this release.  Overall, The New Breed isn't completely terrible, but it loses its novelty after one or two uses.  The three songs on the CD are decent, but you probably have them already.  I would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 Cent / G Unit fans	neg
Everything a mechanic needs, without having all those little bottles and cans leaking every where. The sticks allow precise application of thread sealer or anti-seize. The sticks don't leak or spill, the y don't have nozzles that clog... they are perfect. No waste! ---  --- They were a good deal before but now with the new low price you can afford to get two kits!, buy this and you will not be sorry	pos
i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit "parts" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some "insights" behind the scenes of hollywood)but.... --- some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however	neg
Well, it sounds like a great game, but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades, I couldn't get the video to work at all, couldn't get technical support at all, and I gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer. a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	neg
We looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we've found.  I love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down, it stores flat, and that you can add as many toys as you want.  Our baby has really enjoyed it.  There is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time	pos
Ok magazine....the problem.....we have NOT received one copy.  Can you please help with this???????????????????	pos
I received this product in a timely manner.  It was exactly what I needed. --- Thank you	pos
I've had this phone for a week. I'm using it with T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary. In my opinion, it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone, at least).  ---  --- The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). Fixing it was a matter of rebooting. I think the menu organization could be smarter, but you can customize much of it.  ---  --- I do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. But that screen hides the main menu. Not a huge drawback, but it confused me at first. ---  --- Photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a VGA camera). Since this is a phone first, and not a camera, there is also no stabilization control. It does, however, come with a flash.   ---  --- Sound quality of phone calls is okay. Your friends, family and colleagues will hear you clearly. On your end, however, it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. It's not bad, but I've had conversations on better sounding phones.   ---  --- I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (WLAN) access. It's possible to set a default access point. The problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly, you will have to search for a new network. One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. I agree, however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal.  ---  --- I don't like the SIM card slot. The metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first.  ---  --- The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps too much so. By default, sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard, but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad.   ---  --- The N-80 is also bit awkward. It feels thick for lack of a better word. Its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect.  ---  --- Another drawback: no QWERTY keyboard. You can connect to a wireless one via Bluetooth. But that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. When enabled, it works contextually: on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs. ---  --- Overall, I give this phone high marks for features, but a few annoyances mean it's far from The Perfect Phone	pos
It really doesn't appeal to me. But if you like them that is your opinion. I'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me. But I just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking I mean the creativity here is not very high I just feel you could use better words. But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life. ---  --- Honestly though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these same things when they're 40 right cause that is wrong. I mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together	neg
Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price	neg
